        <p>The selection of the most appropriate algorithm to solve a given problem instance, known as algorithm selection, is driven by the potential to capitalize on the complementary performance of different algorithms across sets of problem instances. However, determining the optimal algorithm for an unseen problem instance has been shown to be a challenging task, which has garnered significant attention from researchers in recent years. In this survey, we conduct an overview of the key contributions to algorithm selection in the field of single-objective continuous black-box optimization. We present ongoing work in representation learning of meta-features for optimization problem instances, algorithm instances, and their interactions. We also study machine learning models for automated algorithm selection, configuration, and performance prediction. Through this analysis, we identify gaps in the state of the art, based on which we present ideas for further development of meta-feature representations.</p>

        <p>The recently proposed MA-BBOB function generator provides a way to create numerical black-box benchmark problems based on the well-established BBOB suite. Initial studies on this generator highlighted its ability to smoothly transition between the component functions, both from a low-level landscape feature perspective, as well as with regard to algorithm performance. This suggests that MA-BBOB-generated functions can be an ideal testbed for automated machine learning methods, such as automated algorithm selection (AAS). In this paper, we generate 11800 functions in dimensions \d=2 and \d=5 respectively, and analyze the potential gains from AAS by studying performance complementarity within a set of eight algorithms. We combine this performance data with exploratory landscape features to create an AAS pipeline that we use to investigate how to efficiently select training sets within this space. We show that simply using the BBOB component functions for training yields poor test performance, while the ranking between uniformly chosen and diversity-based training sets strongly depends on the distribution of the test set.</p>

        <p>The automated design of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms has become increasingly significant, particularly in addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems. Although existing methods have achieved some success, they still face limitations, particularly the high dependency on expert knowledge, pre-solved data, and challenges in interpretability. Genetic Programming (GP), as a proven technology, has shown potential in optimizing the automated design state transition rules of ACO. However, existing research on GP-ACO is insufficient, particularly in terms of experimental validation and systematic evaluation. To address these issues, this study conducts comprehensive experiments to explore several key questions: the generality of GP-ACO on homogeneously distributed maps, the impact of different ACO variants on the learning capabilities of GP-ACO, the effect of 2-opt local search on the learning capabilities of GP-ACO, the enhancement of learning capabilities through the addition of more global information, and the interpretability of GP-ACO. The findings indicate that GP-ACO exhibits robust generality; variations among ACO variants have minimal impact on learning performance; 2-opt local search can somewhat diminish the performance of GP-ACO in the Max-Min Ant System (MMAS); additional global information can significantly enhance the learning capabilities of GP-ACO; and GP-ACO has good interpretability.</p>

        <p>With a recently defined AutoGCOP framework, the design of local search algorithms has been defined as the composition of elementary algorithmic components. The effective compositions of the best algorithms thus retain useful knowledge of effective algorithm design. This paper investigates machine learning to learn and extract useful knowledge in effective algorithmic compositions. The process of forecasting algorithmic components in the design of effective local search algorithms is defined as a sequence classification task, and solved by a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to systematically analyse algorithmic compositions. Compared with other learning models, the results reveal the superior prediction performance of the proposed LSTM. Further analysis identifies some key features of algorithmic compositions and confirms their effectiveness for improving the prediction, thus supporting effective automated algorithm design.</p>

        <p>The diversity of sources and formats of public bidding documents makes collecting, processing, and organizing such documents challenging from the point of view of data analysis. Thus, the development of approaches to deal with such data is relevant since the analysis of them allows to expand of the inclusion of people as they have more access to public decisions and expenditures, increase transparency in the public sector, and give citizens a greater sense of responsibility for having different points of view on the government’s performance in meeting its public policy goals. In this context, we propose PLUS, a semi-automated pipeline for fraud detection in public bids. PLUS comprises a heuristic meta-classifier for bidding documents and a data quality module. Both modules present promising results after a proof of concept, reinforcing the relevance of PLUS for automating the bidding process investigation. Then, we present two applications of PLUS on real-world data: the construction of audit trails for fraud detection and a price database for overpricing detection. Such applications evidence a significant reduction of specialists’ work searching for irregularities in public bids.</p>

        <p>Neural architecture search (NAS) is a rapidly growing field which focuses on the automated design of neural network architectures. Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been predominantly used for evolving neural network architectures. Genetic programming (GP), a variation of GAs that work in the program space rather than a solution space, has not been as well researched for NAS. This paper aims to contribute to the research into GP for NAS. Previous research in this field can be divided into two categories. In the first each program represents neural networks directly or components and parameters of neural networks. In the second category each program is a set of instructions, which when executed, produces a neural network. This study focuses on this second category which has not been well researched. Previous work has used grammatical evolution for generating these programs. This study examines canonical GP for neural network design (GPNND) for this purpose. It also evaluates a variation of GP, iterative structure-based GP (ISBGP) for evolving these programs. The study compares the performance of GAs, GPNND and ISBGP for image classification and video shorts creation. Both GPNND and ISBGP were found to outperform GAs, with ISBGP producing better results than GPNND for both applications. Both GPNND and ISBGP produced better results than previous studies employing grammatical evolution on the CIFAR-10 dataset.</p>

        <p>Generating an image/video caption has always been a fundamental problem of Artificial Intelligence, which is usually performed using the potential of Deep Learning Methods, Computer Vision, Knowledge Graphs, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The significant task of image/video captioning is to describe visual content in terms of natural language. Due to a semantic gap, this presents a massive problem in understanding and explaining images or videos syntactically and semantically. The current systems need somewhere to fill the gap between low‐level and high‐level features while mapping. Therefore, to tackle this problem, there is a need to describe the latest research and methods to overcome difficulties and to propose effective solutions. This work thoroughly analyses and investigates the most related methods (deep learning and knowledge graph‐based approaches), benchmark datasets, and evaluation metrics with their benefits and limitations. Here we have also reviewed the state‐of‐the‐art methods related to image/video captioning and their applications in the current scenario. Finally, we provide thorough information on existing research with comparisons of results on benchmark datasets. We have also mentioned the existing challenges and future direction of research. 1. Demonstrated the significance of deep learning methods in image/video captioning. 2. The article provides a road map for captioning work by Knowledge Graph. 3. Leveraging knowledge graphs can get accurate, rich, and interpretable captions. 4. We summarized 228 research works, primarily from the years 2019 to 2023. 5. This review provides new information and suggestions for improvement.</p>

        <p>The increasing popularity of digital twins, alongside the rapid evolution of connectivity driven by the Internet of Things, highlights their potential to greatly aid in the development of smart cities. Digital twins are employed more commonly as smart cities grow and societies become more interconnected. With the growing need for this technology, there is a pressing demand for the automatic captioning of security events from the videos collected from these models. This is needed as Dtwin models generate a lot of data that makes it difficult to caption them manually. This is required for extracting rich and meaningful higher-level interpretations from images and videos. Current models often lack in-depth insights into these complex urban systems. Additionally, there is a need for a model that can interpret and explain images and videos effectively, leveraging a combination of machine learning and knowledge graph approaches. Therefore, in this paper, we developed the Digital Twin for the buildings and road network of the TEC (Tecnologico De Monterrey) district region and additionally developed the Knowledge Graph models for emulating security events with dense video captioning. This is done by designing an AI-based TEC District Digital Twin for emulating security events by leveraging knowledge graph. The proposed approach provides data and insights about the district’s operations and security. This initiative will help district planners and managers to make better decisions by analyzing the real-time data. This is supposed to contribute to increased effectiveness of district services, transparency, and an efficient infrastructure.</p>

        <p>When dealing with optimisation problems, Metaheuristics (MHs) quickly come to our minds. A quick literature review reveals a vast universe of MHs. Although the metaphors behind these MHs are always presented as ‘unique’ to justify their novelty, the truth is that many MHs just recombine elements from other techniques. Then, instead of proposing MHs based on what already exists in nature, it is better to follow a standard model for the automatic metaheuristic design by employing simple heuristics. Many approaches have designed algorithms that probe the combination of such heuristics, generating astonishing results compared to generic MHs. Following this idea, our work examines Neural Network (NN) architectures over several control variables to tailor MHs. Our results render an architecture that enhances the results compared to generic MHs at 91%, those MHs produced by Random Search at 81%, and the current state-of-the-art NN model at 66%. We notice a big gap for NN-based models with different architectures, which are worth investigating. Among the benefits of our proposed approach is that it reduces the dependence on human knowledge, moving towards the automatic generation of solving methods that learn from empirical data how to succeed in various continuous optimisation scenarios.</p>

        <p>The performance of automated algorithm selection (AAS) strongly depends on the portfolio of algorithms to choose from. Selecting the portfolio is a non-trivial task that requires balancing the trade-off between the higher flexibility of large portfolios with the increased complexity of the AAS task. In practice, probably the most common way to choose the algorithms for the portfolio is a greedy selection of the algorithms that perform well in some reference tasks of interest. We set out in this work to investigate alternative, data-driven portfolio selection techniques. Our proposed method creates algorithm behavior meta-representations, constructs a graph from a set of algorithms based on their meta-representation similarity, and applies a graph algorithm to select a final portfolio of diverse, representative, and non-redundant algorithms. We evaluate two distinct meta-representation techniques (SHAP and performance2vec) for selecting complementary portfolios from a total of 324 different variants of CMA-ES for the task of optimizing the BBOB single-objective problems in dimensionalities 5 and 30 with different cut-off budgets. We test two types of portfolios: one related to overall algorithm behavior and the ‘personalized’ one (related to algorithm behavior per each problem separately). We observe that the approach built on the performance2vec-based representations favors small portfolios with negligible error in the AAS task relative to the virtual best solver from the selected portfolio, whereas the portfolios built from the SHAP-based representations gain from higher flexibility at the cost of decreased performance of the AAS. Across most considered scenarios, personalized portfolios yield comparable or slightly better performance than the classical greedy approach. They outperform the full portfolio in all scenarios.</p>

        <p>In numerical single-objective optimization, auto-mated algorithm selection that uses exploratory landscape analy-sis to describe problem features has achieved great results when the machine learning models used for prediction are trained and tested on the same problem set. However, recent work has shown that the performance of such models decreases when the training and testing sets contain different problems. In this paper, we examine a recently developed algorithm selection model trained on a set of artificial problems and tested on a well-known set of hand-made benchmark problems. This model performed poorly when it was originally presented. Here, we provide an explanation for its poor performance by analyzing the feature importance of the model using Shapley Additive Explanations. We then compare these results to an alternative algorithm selection model that was both trained and tested on the same set of hand-made benchmark problems and achieved much higher performance. This allows us to determine which features each model considers as most significant for their predictions, and where they differ. We show that the original and the alternative model use different landscape features for their predictions, which explains the difference in their performance. Further, by plotting the SHAP values on a 2D plane, we show that the original model is unable to distinguish between certain types of problems. Finally, we show that regardless of their differences in utilizing the features both the original and the alternative models perform poorly on a specific group of problems.</p>

        <p>Accurate and reliable forecasting is a crucial task in many different domains. The selection of a forecasting algorithm that is suitable for a specific time series can be a challenging task, since the algorithms’ performance depends on the time-series properties, as well as the properties of the forecasting algorithms. The methodology and analysis presented in this paper are contributing towards understanding the performance of time-series forecasting methods. Instead of using time-series meta-features only to obtain a good meta-model that can predict the performance of a forecasting algorithm, the methodology can link which features are important for which forecasting methods. We used time-series meta-features extracted using the tsfresh and catch22 libraries. We also found that the importance of the meta-features changes depending on the meta-model that is used. There are only a few meta-features that always appear important for a given forecasting method no matter which meta-model will be used for learning, which further provides opportunities to select a model-agnostic feature portfolio. In addition, different feature importance techniques can provide different results that are related to the methodology that is used by the meta-model. By using the feature importance obtained by a meta-model and a specified feature importance technique, we can define a representation of a forecasting method behavior, which can further provide an insight into which forecasting methods have similar behavior.</p>

        <p>Constraint Programming (CP) is a powerful technique for solving large-scale combinatorial problems. Solving a problem proceeds in two distinct phases: modelling and solving. Effective modelling has a huge impact on the performance of the solving process. Even with the advance of modern automated modelling tools, search spaces involved can be so vast that problems can still be difficult to solve. To further constrain the model, a more aggressive step that can be taken is the addition of streamliner constraints, which are not guaranteed to be sound but are designed to focus effort on a highly restricted but promising portion of the search space. Previously, producing effective streamlined models was a manual, difficult and time-consuming task. This paper presents a completely automated process to the generation, search and selection of streamliner portfolios to produce a substantial reduction in search effort across a diverse range of problems. The results demonstrate a marked improvement in performance for both Chuffed, a CP solver with clause learning, and lingeling, a modern SAT solver.</p>

        <p>In today’s data-driven landscape, time series forecasting is pivotal in decision-making across various sectors. Yet, the proliferation of more diverse time series data, coupled with the expanding landscape of available forecasting methods, poses significant challenges for forecasters. To meet the growing demand for efficient forecasting, we introduce auto-sktime, a novel framework for automated time series forecasting. The proposed framework uses the power of automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques to automate the creation of the entire forecasting pipeline. The framework employs Bayesian optimization, to automatically construct pipelines from statistical, machine learning (ML) and deep neural network (DNN) models. Furthermore, we propose three essential improvements to adapt AutoML to time series data. First, pipeline templates to account for the different supported forecasting models. Second, a novel warm-starting technique to start the optimization from prior optimization runs. Third, we adapt multi-fidelity optimizations to make them applicable to a search space containing statistical, ML and DNN models. Experimental results on 64 diverse real-world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the framework, outperforming traditional methods while requiring minimal human involvement.</p>

        <p>With a recently defined AutoGCOP framework, the design of local search algorithms can be defined as the composition of the basic elementary algorithmic components. These compositions into the best algorithms thus retain useful knowledge of effective algorithm design. This paper investigates effective algorithmic compositions with sequential rule mining techniques to discover valuable knowledge in algorithm design. With the collected effective algorithmic compositions, sequential rules of basic algorithmic components are extracted and further analysed to automatically compose basic algorithmic components within the general AutoGCOP framework to develop new effective meta-heuristics. The sequential rules present superior performance in composing the basic algorithmic components for solving the benchmark vehicle routing problems with time window constraints, demonstrating its effectiveness in designing new algorithms automatically.</p>

        <p>A fundamental problem in chemical product design is how to suitably identify chemical compounds that optimise multiple properties for a given application whilst satisfying relevant constraints. Current product synthesis generally uses trial-and-error experimentation, requiring lengthy and expensive research and development efforts. This paper introduces a novel computational chemistry approach for product design combining geometric deep learning for inference of property values and evolutionary multi-objective optimisation for identification of products of interest. Preliminary empirical results indicate that the proposed approach can be used to optimise product design considering multiple objectives and constraints given incomplete molecular attribute information.</p>

        <p>Unsupervised learning algorithms are popular as they do not require annotated data. However as per the no-free lunch theorem, the best algorithm to use is not the same for all datasets. This study is the first to automate the composition of an unsupervised image clustering algorithm. This work uses two different techniques to perform automated algorithm composition. The first technique is a genetic algorithm (GA) and the second is a genetic algorithm hyperheuristic (GAHH). A comparison of the two techniques shows that the GA outperforms the GAHH. The GA designs unsupervised clustering algorithms that result in state of the art performance for the Oral lesion, Celebrity faces and COVID-19 datasets.</p>

        <p>Metaheuristic algorithms have been investigated intensively to address highly complex combinatorial optimization problems. However, most metaheuristic algorithms have been designed manually by researchers of different expertise without a consistent framework. This article proposes a general search framework (GSF) to formulate in a unified way a range of different metaheuristics. With generic algorithmic components, including selection heuristics and evolution operators, the unified GSF aims to serve as the basis of analyzing algorithmic components for automated algorithm design. With the established new GSF, two reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods, deep  \Q -network based and proximal policy optimization-based methods, have been developed to automatically design a new general population-based algorithm. The proposed RL-based methods are able to intelligently select and combine appropriate algorithmic components during different stages of the optimization process. The effectiveness and generalization of the proposed RL-based methods are validated comprehensively across different benchmark instances of the capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows. This study contributes to making a key step toward automated algorithm design with a general framework supporting fundamental analysis by effective machine learning.</p>

        <p>Automated algorithm design is attracting considerable recent research attention in solving complex combinatorial optimisation problems, due to that most metaheuristics may be particularly effective at certain problems or certain instances of the same problem but perform poorly at others. Within a general algorithm design framework, this study investigates reinforcement learning on the automated design of metaheuristic algorithms. Two groups of features, namely search-dependent and instance-dependent features, are firstly identified to represent the search space of algorithm design to support effective reinforcement learning on the new task of algorithm design. With these key features, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning technique, namely proximal policy optimisation, is employed to automatically combine the basic algorithmic components within the general framework to develop effective metaheuristics. Patterns of the best designed algorithm, in particular the utilisation and transition of algorithmic components, are investigated. Experimental results on the capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the identified features in assisting automated algorithm design with the proposed reinforcement learning model.</p>

        <p>Automated algorithm design has attracted increasing research attention recently in the evolutionary computation community. The main design decisions include selection heuristics and evolution operators in the search algorithms. Most existing studies, however, have focused on the automated design of evolution operators, neglecting selection heuristics for evolution and for replacement, not to mention considering all of the design decisions. This limited the scope of the algorithms under consideration. This study aims to systematically investigate automated design of search algorithms by exploring the impact of individual algorithmic components within a general search framework and the synergy among these multiple algorithmic components utilising a reinforcement learning technique. Comprehensive computational experiments are conducted on different benchmark instances of the capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows to evaluate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method. This study contributes to knowledge discovery in automated algorithm design using machine learning towards significantly enhanced generality of search algorithms.</p>

        <p>In the algorithm selection problem, where the task is to identify the most suitable solving technique for a particular situation, most methods used as performance mapping mechanisms have been relatively simple models such as logistic regression or neural networks. In the latter case, most implementations tend to have a shallow and straightforward architecture and, thus, exhibit a limited ability to extract relevant patterns. This research explores the use of attention-based neural networks as meta-learners to improve the performance mapping mechanism in the algorithm selection problem and fully take advantage of the model’s capabilities for pattern extraction. We compare the proposed use of an attention-based meta-learner method as a performance mapping mechanism against five models from the literature: multi-layer perceptron, k-nearest neighbors, softmax regression, support vector machines, and decision trees. We used a meta-data dataset obtained by solving the vehicle routing problem with time window (VRPTW) instances contained in the Solomon benchmark with three different configurations of the simulated annealing meta-heuristic for testing purposes. Overall, the attention-based meta-learner model yields better results when compared to the other benchmark methods in consistently selecting the algorithm that best solves a given VRPTW instance. Moreover, by significantly outperforming the multi-layer perceptron, our findings suggest promising potential in exploring more recent and novel advancements in neural network architectures.</p>

        <p>Recent advances in technology and devices have caused a data explosion on the Internet and on our home PCs. This data is predominantly obtained in various modalities (text, image, video, etc.) and is essential for e-commerce websites. The products on these websites have both images and descriptions in text form, making them multimodal in nature. Earlier categorization and information retrieval methods focused mostly on a single modality. This study employs multimodal data for classification using neutrosophic fuzzy sets for uncertainty management for information retrieval tasks. This effort utilizes image and text data and, inspired by past techniques of embedding text over an image, attempts to classify the images using neutrosophic classification algorithms. For classification tasks, Neutrosophic Convolutional Neural Networks (NCNNs) are used to learn feature representations of the produced images. We demonstrate how a pipeline based on NCNN can be utilized to learn representations of the innovative fusion method. Traditional convolutional neural networks are vulnerable to unknown noisy conditions in the test phase, and as a result, their performance for the classification of noisy data declines. Comparing our method against individual sources on two large-scale multi-modal categorization datasets yielded good results. In addition, we have compared our method to two well-known multi-modal fusion methodologies, namely early fusion and late fusion.</p>

        <p>Hyper-heuristics are a broad topic that has drawn increasing attention because of its flexibility. This, however, implies that there are diverse models, including selection hyper-heuristics, where the idea is to derive a model that learns when to use each available solver. Nonetheless, such a learning procedure usually proves difficult and leads to non-ideal selections. Hence, in this work, we propose a recursive hyper-heuristic model allowing more complexity within the selection models. Our idea is straightforward: to have a selection hyper-heuristic to select low-level heuristics and lower-level hyper-heuristics. In urlng so, one can merge the combined decisions of existing solvers. We test the feasibility of such a model through experiments on the Job Shop Scheduling Problem that cover small and large datasets of previously tailored instances. We found that increasing the order of the model leads to more stable and better-performing approaches. For example, migrating from a second-order hyper-heuristic to a fourth-order hyper-heuristic reduced the makespan by over 6%. Thus, the proposed model seems feasible and should be further tested under more varied scenarios and conditions.</p>

        <p>Predicting the performance of an optimization algorithm on a new problem instance is crucial in order to select the most appropriate algorithm for solving that problem instance. For this purpose, recent studies learn a supervised machine learning (ML) model using a set of problem landscape features linked to the performance achieved by the optimization algorithm. However, these models are black-box with the only goal of achieving good predictive performance, without providing explanations which landscape features contribute the most to the prediction of the performance achieved by the optimization algorithm. In this study, we investigate the expressiveness of problem landscape features utilized by different supervised ML models in automated algorithm performance prediction. The experimental results point out that the selection of the supervised ML method is crucial, since different supervised ML regression models utilize the problem landscape features differently and there is no common pattern with regard to which landscape features are the most informative.</p>

        <p>The configuration of radar networks is a complex problem that is often performed manually by experts with the help of a simulator. Different numbers and types of radars as well as different locations that the radars shall cover give rise to different instances of the radar configuration problem. The exact modeling of these instances is complex, as the quality of the configurations depends on a large number of parameters, on internal radar processing, and on the terrains on which the radars need to be placed. Classic optimization algorithms can therefore not be applied to this problem, and we rely on "trial-and-error" black-box approaches. In this paper, we study the performances of 13 black-box optimization algorithms on 153 radar network configuration problem instances. The algorithms perform considerably better than human experts. Their ranking, however, depends on the budget of configurations that can be evaluated and on the elevation profile of the location. We therefore also investigate automated algorithm selection approaches. Our results demonstrate that a pipeline that extracts instance features from the elevation of the terrain performs on par with the classical, far more expensive approach that extracts features from the objective function.</p>

        <p>Finding the best configuration of algorithms’ hyperparameters for a given optimization problem is an important task in evolutionary computation. We compare in this work the results of four different hyperparameter optimization (HPO) approaches for a family of genetic algorithms (GAs) on 25 diverse pseudo-Boolean optimization (PBO) problems. More precisely, we compare previously obtained results from a grid search with those obtained from three automated configuration techniques: 1) iterated racing; 2) mixed-integer parallel-efficient global optimization (MIP-EGO); and 3) mixed-integer evolutionary strategies. Using two different cost metrics: 1) expected running time (ERT) and 2) the area under the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) curve, we find that in several cases the best configurations with respect to ERT are obtained when using the area under the ECDF curve as the cost metric during the configuration process. Our results suggest that even when interested in ERT performance, it might be preferable to use anytime performance measures for the configuration task. We also observe that tuning for ERT is much more sensitive with respect to the budget that is allocated to the target algorithms.</p>

        <p>The combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with deep learning has led to a series of impressive feats, with many believing (deep) RL provides a path towards generally capable agents. However, the success of RL agents is often highly sensitive to design choices in the training process, which may require tedious and error-prone manual tuning. This makes it challenging to use RL for new problems, while also limits its full potential. In many other areas of machine learning, AutoML has shown it is possible to automate such design choices and has also yielded promising initial results when applied to RL. However, Automated Reinforcement Learning (AutoRL) involves not only standard applications of AutoML but also includes additional challenges unique to RL, that naturally produce a different set of methods. As such, AutoRL has been emerging as an important area of research in RL, providing promise in a variety of applications from RNA design to playing games such as Go. Given the diversity of methods and environments considered in RL, much of the research has been conducted in distinct subfields, ranging from meta-learning to evolution. In this survey we seek to unify the field of AutoRL, we provide a common taxonomy, discuss each area in detail and pose open problems which would be of interest to researchers going forward.</p>

        <p>Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms form a class of surrogate-based heuristics, aimed at efficiently computing high-quality solutions for numerical black-box optimization problems. The BO pipeline is highly modular, with different design choices for the initial sampling strategy, the surrogate model, the acquisition function (AF), the solver used to optimize the AF, etc. We demonstrate in this work that a dynamic selection of the AF can benefit the BO design. More precisely, we show that already a na\"ive random forest regression model, built on top of exploratory landscape analysis features that are computed from the initial design points, suffices to recommend AFs that outperform any static choice, when considering performance over the classic BBOB benchmark suite for derivative-free numerical optimization methods on the COCO platform. Our work hence paves a way towards AutoML-assisted, on-the-fly BO designs that adjust their behavior on a run-by-run basis.</p>

        <p>Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is used more than ever before to support users in determining efficient hyperparameters, neural architectures, or even full machine learning pipelines. However, users tend to mistrust the optimization process and its results due to a lack of transparency, making manual tuning still widespread. We introduce DeepCAVE, an interactive framework to analyze and monitor state-of-the-art optimization procedures for AutoML easily and ad hoc. By aiming for full and accessible transparency, DeepCAVE builds a bridge between users and AutoML and contributes to establishing trust. Our framework’s modular and easy-to-extend nature provides users with automatically generated text, tables, and graphic visualizations. We show the value of DeepCAVE in an exemplary use-case of outlier detection, in which our framework makes it easy to identify problems, compare multiple runs and interpret optimization processes. The package is freely available on GitHub https://github.com/automl/DeepCAVE.</p>

        <p>Recent years have witnessed tremendously improved efficiency of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), especially Automated Deep Learning (AutoDL) systems, but recent work focuses on tabular, image, or NLP tasks. So far, little attention has been paid to general AutoDL frameworks for time series forecasting, despite the enormous success in applying different novel architectures to such tasks. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for the joint optimization of neural architecture and hyperparameters of the entire data processing pipeline for time series forecasting. In contrast to common NAS search spaces, we designed a novel neural architecture search space covering various state-of-the-art architectures, allowing for an efficient macro-search over different DL approaches. To efficiently search in such a large configuration space, we use Bayesian optimization with multi-fidelity optimization. We empirically study several different budget types enabling efficient multi-fidelity optimization on different forecasting datasets. Furthermore, we compared our resulting system, dubbed \textbackslashsystem, against several established baselines and show that it significantly outperforms all of them across several datasets.</p>

        <p>The multipoint dynamic aggregation (MPDA) problem of the multirobot system is of great significance for its real-world applications such as bush fire elimination. The problem is to design the optimal plan for a set of heterogeneous robots to complete some geographically distributed tasks collaboratively. In this article, we consider the dynamic version of the problem, where new tasks keep appearing after the robots are dispatched from the depot. The dynamic MPDA problem is a complicated optimization problem due to several characteristics, such as the collaboration of robots, the accumulative task demand, the relationships among robots and tasks, and the unpredictable task arrivals. In this article, a new model of the problem considering these characteristics is proposed. To solve the problem, we develop a new genetic programming hyperheuristic (GPHH) method to evolve reactive coordination strategies (RCSs), which can guide the robots to make decisions in real time. The proposed GPHH method contains a newly designed effective RCS heuristic template to generate the execution plan for the robots according to a GP tree. A new terminal set of features related to both robots and tasks and a cluster filter that assigns the robots to urgent tasks are designed. The experimental results show that the proposed GPHH significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. Through further analysis, useful insights such as how to distribute and coordinate robots to execute different types of tasks are discovered.</p>

        <p>Evolutionary multitask multiobjective learning has been widely used for handling more than one multiobjective task simultaneously. However, it is rarely used in dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, which have valuable practical applications such as dynamic flexible job-shop scheduling (DFJSS) in manufacturing. Genetic programming (GP), as a popular hyperheuristic approach, has been used to learn scheduling heuristics for generating schedules for multitask single-objective DFJSS only. Searching in the heuristic space with GP is more difficult than in the solution space, since a small change on heuristics can lead to ineffective or even infeasible solutions. Multiobjective DFJSS is more challenging than single DFJSS, since a scheduling heuristic needs to cope with multiple objectives. To tackle this challenge, we first propose a multipopulation-based multitask multiobjective GP algorithm to preserve the quality of the learned scheduling heuristics for each task. Furthermore, we develop a multitask multiobjective GP algorithm with a task-oriented knowledge-sharing strategy to further improve the effectiveness of learning scheduling heuristics for DFJSS. The results show that the designed multipopulation-based GP algorithms, especially the one with the task-oriented knowledge-sharing strategy, can achieve good performance for all the examined tasks by maintaining the quality and diversity of individuals for corresponding tasks well. The learned Pareto fronts also show that the GP algorithm with task-oriented knowledge-sharing strategy can learn competitive scheduling heuristics for DFJSS on both of the objectives.</p>

        <p>The present study introduces two methods for constructing portfolios of low-level heuristics, to be used by Selection Hyper-heuristics to solve Protein Structure Prediction with the 2D HP model. Protein Structure Prediction is useful and practical for various application domains, particularly in medicine. As the protein structures are linked to the proteins’ functionalities, it is critical to have efficient strategies to identify the proteins’ structures. The traditional methods happening in the lab environments are impractical and impossible to go with the pace of the requirements for determining certain protein structures. Algorithmic approaches come into play to fill this gap by utilizing computational resources. Despite the relevant algorithm development efforts, there is no single algorithm that can truly address this structure prediction problem. Different algorithms take the lead on distinct problem scenarios. Selection Hyper-heuristics provide a way of benefiting from multiple algorithms, i.e. low-level heuristics, on-the-fly. However, the choice of those algorithms largely affect the performance. Thus, it is critical to come up with the low-level heuristic sets or portfolios that can be effectively used by Selection Hyper-heuristics for solving a specific target problem. This paper investigates two clustering-based methods for addressing the portfolio design task. The reported experimental analysis shows that the proposed methods are able to deliver competitive portfolios with significantly less number of low-level heuristics than the human-designed complete low-level heuristic set.</p>

        <p>One application for using government data is the detection of irregularities that may indicate fraud in the public sector. This paper presents an approach that analyzes public bidding data available on the Web to detect bidder inconsistencies. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical decision approach from public bidding data, where each bidder is classified as Valid, Doubtful, or Invalid, based on the compatibility between the bidding items and the divisions of the CNAE codes (National Classification of Economic activities). The results reveal that combining commonly available data on bidders and extracting the description of bid items can help in fraud detection. Furthermore, the proposed approach can reduce the number of bids a specialist must analyze to detect fraud, making it easier to identify inconsistencies.</p>

        <p>The automated design of optimization techniques holds great promise for advancing state-of-the-art optimization techniques and it has already taken over the manual design by human experts in some problems. Genetic algorithms are one of the key approaches for tackling the automated design problem. Unfortunately, these algorithms may take several hours to run as the fitness evaluation involves solving some benchmark instances to determine the quality of a candidate configuration. In this paper, we hybridize a meta-genetic algorithm with reinforcement learning to automatically design genetic algorithms for the two-dimensional bin packing problem. The task of the meta-genetic algorithm is to search the configuration space of genetic algorithms and the task of reinforcement learning is to decide whether to evaluate a candidate configuration or not. Therefore, avoiding wasting the computational budget on poor configurations. The proposed hybrid and the meta-genetic algorithm without reinforcement learning produce solvers for the two-dimensional bin packing problem that are competitive with the state-of-the-art algorithms. However, the proposed hybrid consumes about 25% of the computational effort required by the meta-genetic algorithm without reinforcement learning.</p>

        <p>When urlng image processing it has been shown that the use of an appropriate feature extraction function can result in a significant boost in performance. Selecting or creating the correct feature extraction function is however non-trivial. This work uses grammatical evolution (GE) to evolve a feature extraction function for images. The goal is to evolve feature extraction functions that are able to improve the clustering results of three different unsupervised clustering algorithms: KMeans++, DBSCAN and Mean Shift. In order to test whether the feature extraction functions evolved by the GE are effective, the clustering algorithms are also used with no feature extraction and with randomly generated feature extraction functions. The results of experimentation show that using a GE to evolve a feature extraction function is more effective than using no feature extraction or randomly generated feature extraction, with the exception of K-Means++ when applied to the Oral lesion dataset where GE feature extraction performed equally as good as when no feature extraction is used. A possible reason for this might be that the grammar for the GE needs additional operators to generate color specific features. Future work includes applying transfer learning to the GE.</p>

        <p>Deep neural networks have proven to be effective in various domains, especially in natural language processing and image processing. However, one of the challenges associated with using deep neural networks includes the long design time and expertise needed to apply these neural networks to a particular domain. The research presented in this paper investigates the automation of the design of the deep neural network pipeline to overcome this challenge. The deep learning pipeline includes identifying the preprocessing needed, the feature engineering technique, the neural network to use and the parameters for the neural network. A selection pertubative hyper-heuristic (SPHH) is used to automate the design pipeline. The study also examines the reusability of the generated pipeline. The effectiveness of transfer learning on the generated designs is also investigated. The proposed approach is evaluated for text processing—namely, sentiment analysis and spam detection—and image processing—namely, maize disease detection and oral lesion detection. The study revealed that the automated design of the deep neural network pipeline produces just as good, and in some cases better, performance compared to the manual design, with the automated design requiring less design time than the manual design. In the majority of instances, the design was not reusable; however, transfer learning achieved positive transfer of designs, with the performance being just as good or better than when transfer learning was not used.</p>

        <p>The automated design of search techniques is a recent trend in artificial intelligence research. Unfortunately, the majority of the automated design approaches are developed using trial and error which fails to justify or at least explain why some design decisions succeed while others fail. This approach is a host of evils as it has resulted in poorly understood systems for poorly understood problems. This study is an attempt to improve our understanding of the automated design of hybrid metaheuristics by utilizing fitness landscape analysis to reveal the topological characteristics that can be exploited to design better automated approaches. We consider the sequential hybridization, including algorithm configuration and parameter tuning, of single-point and multi-point metaheuristics and three optimization problems which are the earth-observing satellite scheduling problem, the aircraft landing problem and the two-dimensional bin packing problem. Interestingly, the design space exhibits similar trends regardless of the underlining optimization problem. The design space is found to be rugged, multimodal, moderately searchable, has multiple funnels, and almost no plateau. Based on these findings, deeper insights are provided to guide the development of future automated approaches instead of blindly trying different options.</p>

        <p>Metaheuristics (MHs) are proven powerful algorithms for solving non-linear optimisation problems over discrete, continuous, or mixed domains. Applications have ranged from basic sciences to applied technologies. Nowadays, the literature contains plenty of MHs based on exceptional ideas, but often, they are just recombining elements from other techniques. An alternative approach is to follow a standard model that customises population-based MHs, utilising simple heuristics extracted from well-known MHs. Different approaches have explored the combination of such simple heuristics, generating excellent results compared to the generic MHs. Nevertheless, they present limitations due to the nature of the metaheuristic used to study the heuristic space. This work investigates a field of action for implementing a model that takes advantage of previously modified MHs by learning how to boost the performance of the tailoring process. Following this reasoning, we propose a hyper-heuristic model based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained with processed sequences of heuristics to identify patterns that one can use to generate better MHs. We prove the feasibility of this model by comparing the results against generic MHs and other approaches that tailor unfolded MHs. Our results evidenced that the proposed model outperformed an average of 84 % of all scenarios; in particular, 89 % of basic and 77 % of unfolded approaches. Plus, we highlight the configurable capability of the proposed model, as it shows to be exceptionally versatile in regards to the computational budget, generating good results even with limited resources.</p>

        <p>Ever since the outbreak of COVID-19, the entire world is grappling with panic over its rapid spread. Consequently, it is of utmost importance to detect its presence. Timely diagnostic testing leads to the quick identification, treatment and isolation of infected people. A number of deep learning classifiers have been proved to provide encouraging results with higher accuracy as compared to the conventional method of RT-PCR testing. Chest radiography, particularly for using X-ray images, is a prime imaging modality for detecting the suspected COVID-19 patients. However, the performance of these approaches still needs to be improved. In this paper, we propose a capsule network called COVID-WideNet for diagnosing COVID-19 cases using Chest X-ray (CXR) images. Experimental results have demonstrated that a discriminative trained, multi-layer capsule network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COVIDx dataset. In particular, COVID-WideNet performs better than any other CNN based approaches for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infected patients. Further, the proposed COVID-WideNet has the number of trainable parameters that is 20 times less than that of other CNN based models. This results in a fast and efficient diagnosing COVID-19 symptoms, and with achieving the 0.95 of Area Under Curve (AUC), 91% of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, respectively. This may also assist radiologists to detect COVID and its variant like delta.</p>

        <p>The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem is a well-known NP-hard problem that poses the challenge of finding the optimal route of a vehicle delivering products to multiple locations. Recently, new efforts have emerged to create constructive and perturbative heuristics to tackle this problem using Deep Learning. In this paper, we join these efforts to develop the Combined Deep Constructor and Perturbator, which combines two powerful constructive and perturbative Deep Learning-based heuristics, using attention mechanisms at their core. Furthermore, we improve the Attention Model-Dynamic for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem by proposing a memory-efficient algorithm that reduces its memory complexity by a factor of the number of nodes. Our method shows promising results. It demonstrates a cost improvement in common datasets when compared against other multiple Deep Learning methods. It also obtains close results to the state-of-the art heuristics from the Operations Research field. Additionally, the proposed memory efficient algorithm for the Attention Model-Dynamic model enables its use in problem instances with more than 100 nodes.</p>

        <p>Hyper-heuristics have arisen as methods that increase the generality of existing solvers. They have proven helpful for dealing with complex problems, particularly those related to combinatorial optimization. Their recent growth in popularity has increased the daily amount of text in the related literature. This information is primarily unstructured, mainly text that traditional computer data systems cannot process. Traditional systematic literature review studies exhibit multiple limitations, including high time consumption, lack of replicability, and subjectivity of the results. For this reason, text mining has become essential for researchers in recent years. Therefore, efficient text mining techniques are needed to extract meaningful information, patterns, and relationships. This study adopts a literature review of 963 journal and conference papers on hyper-heuristic-related works. We first describe the essential text mining techniques, including text preprocessing, word clouds, clustering, and frequent association rule learning in hyper-heuristic publications. With that information, we implement visualization tools to understand the most frequent relations and topics in the hyper-heuristic domain. The main findings highlight the most dominant topics in the literature. We use text mining analysis to find widespread manifestations, representing the significance of the different areas of hyper-heuristics. Furthermore, we apply clustering to provide seven categories showing the associations between the topics related to hyper-heuristic literature. The vast amount of data available that we find opens up a new opportunity for researchers to analyze the status of hyper-heuristics and help create strategic plans regarding the scope of hyper-heuristics. Lastly, we remark that future work will address the limitations of collecting information from multiple data sources and analyze book chapters related to hyper-heuristics.</p>

        <p>Recent years have witnessed significant achievements and technological advances in citizen science (CS) projects; nevertheless, significant global challenges are present. Proof of this is in the joint efforts of international organizations to achieve the 2030 SDG agenda in a complex environment. Thus, UNESCO has recognized CS as being among the initiatives that could bridge the Science, Technology, and Innovation gap as a substantial resource, given its power to bring the general public closer together. Although tech-based CS projects keep rising, there is limited knowledge about which type of projects might allow participants to develop higher-order complex thinking skills. To that end, this study describes a systematic literature review (SLR) and analysis of 49 CS projects over the last 5 years concerning the technology utilized, the level of citizen involvement, and the intended social impact. The results of the analysis evidenced: (a) broad implementation in Europe on issues of the built environment, disaster risk, and environmental and animal monitoring; (b) prevalence of helix configurations other than the triple, quadruple, and quintuple helix innovation models; (c) a focus on technological developments to improve living conditions in cities; (d) an opportunity to develop applied native technologies; (e) limited development of participants’ complex thinking, when constrained to low levels of involvement; and (f) an opportunity to develop native technologies and promote a higher level of citizen participation, leading to more significant impact whilst developing complex thinking.</p>

        <p>Regarding safety and security, felonies and crimes with physical violence remain a significant problem worldwide. Some solutions for pedestrian safety are guards, police car patrolling, sensors, and security cameras. Nonetheless, these methods react only when the crime takes place. In the worst cases, the damage may be irreversible when it has already occurred. Therefore, numerous methods based on Artificial Intelligence have been proposed to solve this problem. Many approaches to detect violent behavior and action recognition rely on 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs), spatio-temporal models, long short-term memory networks, pose estimation, among other implementations. However, these approaches work in a limited fashion and have not been adapted to uncontrolled environments. Thus, a significant contribution from this work is the development of an innovative solution model capable of detecting violent behavior. This approach focuses on pedestrian detection, tracking, pose estimation, and neural networks to predict pedestrian behavior in video frames. Our proposal uses a time window frame to extract joint angles, given by the pose estimation algorithm, as features for classifying behavior. Another significant contribution of this work is the creation of a new database, Kranok-NV, with a total of 3,683 normal and violent videos. This database was used to train and test the solution model. For the evaluation, we designed a protocol using 10-fold cross-validation. We obtained an accuracy slightly above 98% on the Kranok-NV database with the implemented solution model. Although the proposed solution model detects violent and normal behavior, it can be easily extended to classify other types of behavior.</p>

        <p>Violence has remained a momentous problem since time immemorial. Various scientific studies are conducted in the recent past to identify the stimuli causing violent behavior among the masses and to achieve the target of cloud data protection. Given the inherent ambiguity or indeterminacy in human behaviour, this study in the area of violence detection appears to be effective, as it finds a variety of stimuli and character qualities that contribute to violent conduct among masses. This uncertainty of traits causing violence can easily be seen in surveillance data present over the cloud and also from the data collected using academic research. Therefore, for the purpose of identifying violent behavior we have considered the factors (data) from existing research and from data over clouds. The factors that lead to violent behavior and are identified by algorithms running over clouds are termed as determinate or certain factors. The factors that were not considered and least identified by the cloud algorithms and given less importance are termed indeterminate factors or uncertain factors. The indeterminate factors are also considered based on the expert’s opinion where the experts are not in a condition to provide a clear stance or when they are neutral in their opinion. Tests are performed using Neutrosophic Cognitive Maps (NCMs) to model the violent behavior taking into consideration both determinate and indeterminate factors. Earlier these tests were performed using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) where indeterminate or uncertain factors were not considered. Therefore, we provide a brief comparison between NCMs and FCMs and show how effective NCMs are when we need to consider the uncertainty of concepts while carrying out tests for identifying violent behavior. Later results are obtained by forming a Neutrosophic adjacency matrix which is evaluated using the concepts of linear algebra. The obtained results in the form of 1 ∗ n vector (1 I I I I 1 I 1 I I I I I I I I I I I ) clearly shows the presence of indeterminate factor ‘I’ in the vector which was absent in earlier models when designed using FCMs. This shows how these indeterminate or uncertain factors play a significant role in cultivating violent behavior which was not shown in the previous study. The study is significant since it takes into account factors from cloud data, experts’ opinions, and also from literature, and shows how these factors are taken into consideration at the data level itself so that they will not impact the modeling stage, and machine learning algorithms will perform well because uncertain and indeterminate information is taken care of at training phase itself. Hence uncertainty could be reduced in machine learning algorithms and in the overall recognition of violent behavior.</p>

        <p>Security has become a critical issue for complex and expensive systems and day-to-day situations. In this regard, the analysis of surveillance cameras is a critical issue usually restricted to the number of people devoted to such a task, their knowledge and judgment. Nonetheless, different approaches have arisen to automate this task in recent years. These approaches are mainly based on machine learning and benefit from developing neural networks capable of extracting underlying information from input videos. Despite how competent those networks have proved to be, developers must face the challenging task of defining both the architecture and hyperparameters that allow such networks to work adequately and optimize the use of computational resources. In short, this work proposes a model that generates, through a genetic algorithm, neural networks for behavior classification within videos. Two types of neural networks evolved as part of this work, shallow and deep, which are structured on dense and 3D convolutional layers. Each network requires a particular type of input data: the evolution of the pose of people in the video and video sequences, respectively. Shallow neural networks use a direct encoding approach to map each part of the chromosome into a phenotype. In contrast, deep neural networks use indirect encoding, blueprints representing entire networks, and modules to depict layers and their connections. Our approach obtained relevant results when tested on the Kranok-NV dataset and evaluated with standard metrics used for similar classification tasks.</p>

        <p>Hyper-heuristics (HHs) stand as a relatively recent approach to solving optimization problems. There are different kinds of HHs. One of them deals with how low-level heuristics must be combined to deliver an improved solution to a set of problem instances. Literature commonly refers to them as selection hyper-heuristics. One of their advantages is that the strengths of each heuristic can be fused into a high-level solver. However, one of their drawbacks is that sometimes this generalization scheme does not suffice. Additionally, it is not easy to reuse these HHs since the model cannot be easily tweaked. So, in this work, we develop a hyper-heuristic model with an additional layer of generalization. The rationale behind it is to preserve the general structure of selecting an adequate solver for a particular situation but to use HHs instead of low-level heuristics. We call this model a Squared Hyper-Heuristic (SHH). To validate our proposal, we pursue a four-stage methodology that covers several testing scenarios. Our data reveal that, under proper conditions, our model can outperform the base HHs. Moreover, it is flexible enough to allow for an increased number of layers so that the complexity of the final model can be tuned. Additionally, different kinds of instances can be used to train each stage of the model, thus setting the groundwork for developing a transfer learning approach for hyper-heuristics.</p>

        <p>A plethora of combinatorial optimization problems can be linked to real-life decision scenarios. Even nowadays, more diverse and complex problems are popping up. One of these problems is the traveling thief problem (TTP), which combines elements from the knapsack and traveling salesperson problems. Hence, it is paramount to keep improving solvers to tackle combinatorial problems. Among recent proposals, hyper-heuristics have proven useful since they seek to combine the strengths of more straightforward solvers. This paper proposes a sequence-based selection hyper-heuristic and assesses its feasibility when solving the TTP. Our proposal can be represented by an array of operators selecting a city or an item. In the first case, the solution moves to a new city and thus advances the tour. In the second one, the thief agent picks an item within the current city and tries to store it in its knapsack. We generate several sets of TTP instances with different parameters to validate our approach and analyze the model’s performance. Our data reveal that the proposed approach outperforms randomly generated sequences. Moreover, our approach finds general sequences that surpass sequences specialized for each instance. We believe this is noteworthy and represents a stepping stone towards achieving a more robust solver for complex problems.</p>

        <p>Hyper-Heuristics (HHs) have proven to be a valuable tool for solving complex problems, such as Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs). These solvers have an assorted set of models arising through extensive research from the scientific community. Hence, it is customary that researchers develop their models from scratch, which increases development times. Drafting and testing new ideas become burdensome and time-consuming. In this work, we present MatHH, a Matlab-based framework to allow rapid prototyping of HHs. We summarize the architecture and some examples of their usage. We also discuss some research questions that upcoming research may explore through MatHH.</p>

        <p>Although swarm robotics is widely recognized as a promising approach to coordinating large groups of robots, a general methodology for designing collective behaviors for robot swarms is still missing. Automatic off-line design is an appealing solution but it is prone to the so-called reality gap, which is the reason for performance drops when control software developed in simulation is deployed on real robots. We present here our research on AutoMoDe, a novel approach to the automatic off-line design of robot swarms, which is based on the principle of modularity. AutoMoDe produces control software for robot swarms by selecting, combining, instantiating, and fine-tuning predefined parametric modules that represent low-level behaviors defined in a mission-agnostic way. By restricting the generation of control software to the instances that can be produced with the given modules, we effectively inject a bias in the design process and consequently reduce its variance. As confirmed by the empirical studies realized so far, this reduces the risk of overfitting simulation models and improves the chances of crossing the reality gap successfully.</p>

        <p>Finding the best configuration of algorithms’ hyperparameters for a given optimization problem is an important task in evolutionary computation. We compare in this work the results of four different hyperparameter tuning approaches for a family of genetic algorithms on 25 diverse pseudo-Boolean optimization problems. More precisely, we compare previously obtained results from a grid search with those obtained from three automated configuration techniques: iterated racing, mixed-integer parallel efficient global optimization, and mixed-integer evolutionary strategies. Using two different cost metrics, expected running time and the area under the empirical cumulative distribution function curve, we find that in several cases the best configurations with respect to expected running time are obtained when using the area under the empirical cumulative distribution function curve as the cost metric during the configuration process. Our results suggest that even when interested in expected running time performance, it might be preferable to use anytime performance measures for the configuration task. We also observe that tuning for expected running time is much more sensitive with respect to the budget that is allocated to the target algorithms.</p>

        <p>We present a first proof-of-concept use-case that demonstrates the efficiency of interfacing the algorithm framework ParadisEO with the automated algorithm configuration tool irace and the experimental platform IOHprofiler. By combing these three tools, we obtain a powerful benchmarking environment that allows us to systematically analyze large classes of algorithms on complex benchmark problems. Key advantages of our pipeline are fast evaluation times, the possibility to generate rich data sets to support the analysis of the algorithms, and a standardized interface that can be used to benchmark very broad classes of sampling-based optimization heuristics. In addition to enabling systematic algorithm configuration studies, our approach paves a way for assessing the contribution of new ideas in interplay with already existing operators – a promising avenue for our research domain, which at present may have a too strong focus on comparing entire algorithm instances.</p>

        <p>We present a first proof-of-concept use-case that demonstrates the efficiency of interfacing the algorithm framework ParadisEO with the automated algorithm configuration tool irace and the experimental platform IOHprofiler. By combing these three tools, we obtain a powerful benchmarking environment that allows us to systematically analyze large classes of algorithms on complex benchmark problems. Key advantages of our pipeline are fast evaluation times, the possibility to generate rich data sets to support the analysis of the algorithms, and a standardized interface that can be used to benchmark very broad classes of sampling-based optimization heuristics. In addition to enabling systematic algorithm configuration studies, our approach paves a way for assessing the contribution of new ideas in interplay with already existing operators – a promising avenue for our research domain, which at present may have a too strong focus on comparing entire algorithm instances.</p>

        <p>Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the sub-field of machine learning that aims at automating, to some extend, all stages of the design of a machine learning system. In the context of supervised learning, AutoML is concerned with feature extraction, preprocessing, model design, and post processing. Major contributions and achievements in AutoML have been taking place during the recent decade. We are, therefore, in perfect timing to look back and realize what we have learned. This chapter aims to summarize the main findings in the early years of AutoML. More specifically, in this chapter an introduction to AutoML for supervised learning is provided and a historical review of progress in this field is presented. Likewise, the main paradigms of AutoML are described and research opportunities are outlined.</p>

        <p>Uncertain Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (UCARP) is a variant of the well-known CARP. It considers a variety of stochastic factors to reflect the reality where the exact information such as the actual task demand and accessibilities of edges are unknown in advance. Existing works focus on obtaining a robust solution beforehand. However, it is also important to design effective heuristics to adjust the solution in real time. In this paper, we develop a new Genetic Programming-based Hyper-Heuristic (GPHH) for automated heuristic design for UCARP. A novel effective meta-algorithm is designed carefully to address the failures caused by the environment change. In addition, it employs domain knowledge to filter some infeasible candidate tasks for the heuristic function. The experimental results show that the proposed GPHH significantly out performs the existing GPHH methods and manually designed heuristics. Moreover, we find that eliminating the infeasible and distant tasks in advance can reduce much noise and improve the efficacy of the evolved heuristics. In addition, it is found that simply adding a slack factor to the expected task demand may not improve the performance of the GPHH. \copyright 2017 ACM . This is the author’s version of the work.

        <p>Genetic Programming Hyper-heuristics (GPHHs) have been successfully applied in various problem domains for automatically designing heuristics such as dispatching rules in scheduling and routing policies in vehicle routing. In the real world, it is normal to encounter related problem domains, such as the vehicle routing problem with different objectives, constraints, and/or graph topology. On one hand, different heuristics are required for different problem domains. On the other hand, the knowledge learned from solving previous related problem domains can be helpful for solving the current one. Most existing studies solve different problem domains in isolation, and train/evolve the heuristic for each of them from scratch. In this chapter, we investigate different mechanisms to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the heuristic retraining by employing knowledge transfer. Specifically, in the context of GPHH, we explored the following two transfer strategies: (1) useful subtrees and (2) importance of terminals, and verified their effectiveness in a case study of the uncertain capacitated arc routing problem.</p>

        <p>This paper proposes AutoGCOP, a new general framework for automated design of local search algorithms. In a recently established General Combinatorial Optimisation Problem (GCOP) model, the problem of algorithm design itself is defined as a combinatorial optimisation problem. AutoGCOP defines a general framework to optimise the composition of elementary algorithmic components as decision variables in GCOP. By modelling various well-known local search meta-heuristics within a general framework, AutoGCOP supports automatic design of new novel algorithms which may be highly different from those manually designed in the literature. Within the consistent AutoGCOP framework, various elementary algorithmic components are analysed for solving the benchmark vehicle routing problem with time window constraints and different characteristics. Furthermore, two learning models based on reinforcement learning and Markov chain are investigated to learn and enhance the compositions of algorithmic components towards the automated design of search algorithms. The Markov chain model presents superior performance learning the compositions of algorithmic components during the search, demonstrating its effectiveness designing new algorithms automatically.</p>

        <p>Algorithm design is a general task for any problem-solving scenario. For Search and Optimization, this task becomes rather challenging due to the immense algorithm design space. Those existing design options are usually traversed to devise algorithms by the human algorithm development experts together with the specialists on the target problem domains. The resulting algorithms are mostly problem-specific as they are unable to solve a different problem than the current target. Unlike the traditionally developed algorithms, Hyper-heuristics are known as problem-independent solvers pursuing the grand goal of generality. Generality, in this context, means that effectively solving different problems with a single algorithm under varying experimental conditions. This generality element is chased by performing a high-level search across the algorithm space differently than the majority of the algorithms directly operating on the solution space. In that respect, by design, a hyper-heuristic can be applied to any problem with a search space of quantifiable solutions. This flexibility coming from their easy-to-use nature has been validated in various academic and real-world applications. The present chapter provides a general overview of hyper-heuristics while discussing their shortcomings and recipes for future hyper-heuristic research.</p>

        <p>The present work applies Algorithm Selection for automatically determining the best energy functions for search algorithms on Protein Structure Prediction. Protein Structure Prediction is a critical problem concerned with exploring the structure of a protein, given an amino acid sequence. For the sake of improved search performance, various models have been introduced such as the Hydrophobic Polar (HP) models. These models make PSP computationally approachable. There exists a large suite of algorithms introduces to solve PSP. As in all other problem domains, it is possible to see that the PSP algorithms considered to be strong can fail to address some problem instances. One way of providing further performance improvements without devising a new algorithm is to automatically determine the best possible algorithm for a given PSP problem instance. Algorithm Selection focuses on automatically choosing algorithms for any given problem solving scenario. Unlike the traditional use of AS, this study accommodates Algorithm Selection for specifying the best suited energy function used for search. The process is designed as a rank prediction task on 7 energy functions for Iterated Local Search as the optimization algorithm. The idea is to assess the best energy function that can guide the search process of Iterated Local Search on a per-instance basis. An experimental analysis is reported on 30 PSP instances, each half belongs to the 2D and 3D HP models, respectively. The results show that Algorithm Selection is capable to offer proper selection of the energy functions with robustness. Additionally, a brief algorithm and instance analysis is reported on the instance hardness and matching algorithmic capabilities. This analysis further provides insights on the instance hardness besides instance and algorithm similarities.</p>

        <p>Data classification provides effective solutions to various real-world problems in areas such as disease diagnosis, network intrusion detection, and financial forecasting, among others. Classification algorithms such as induction algorithms, e.g., ID3, and genetic programming are used to produce classifiers. The design of these classification algorithms is time-consuming, requiring many person hours, and is an optimization problem. This chapter examines the automated design of genetic programming as a classification algorithm. The study compares the performance of genetic algorithms and grammatical evolution in automating the design of genetic programming for classifier induction. The performance of the classifiers produced by automated design is compared to that produced by manually designed genetic programming algorithms for binary and multi-class classification in various areas including network intrusion detection and financial forecasting. The automated design required less design time and produced classifiers that performed better than the manually designed classifiers. Grammatical evolution was found to produce better-performing classifiers for binary classification and genetic algorithms for multi-class classification.</p>

        <p>We provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in the time complexity analysis of selection hyper-heuristics for combinatorial optimisation. These algorithms aim at automating the optimisation process by using a set of low-level heuristics and a machine learning mechanism to decide online which heuristic is the most appropriate one at the current stage. We mainly focus on work that establishes the performance gains that simple and sophisticated hyper-heuristics can achieve compared to the low-level heuristics applied in isolation, and that compares the expected runtime of the hyper-heuristics against the best possible one achievable with the given set of low-level heuristics. We cover examples where mixing heuristics is necessary, as well as others where learning from the past performance of the applied heuristics is crucial for the algorithms to be efficient. We emphasise that simple and sophisticated hyper-heuristics from the literature can achieve optimal performance for some standard unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. Problem characteristics are highlighted for which more or less machine learning sophistication is required, and insights are provided of how a rigorous theory can guide the design of more efficient hyper-heuristics.</p>

        <p>This study builds on previous work in which Mask R-CNN was used to quantify common rust severity on maize leaves grown in a greenhouse environment. The Mask R-CNN outperformed standard image processing techniques when applied to the rust quantification task. One of the challenges with using Mask R-CNN is the large amount of parameters that need to be tuned, this study examines automated tuning of these parameters. This study is the first to perform hyper-parameter tuning on the Mask R-CNN at this scale as well as using a genetic algorithm (GA). The results gathered from the GA implementation is compared to that of the prior results from the Mask R-CNN with manually selected hyper-parameters. This work concludes that using a genetic algorithm to determine optimal hyper-parameter values for the Mask R-CNN is comparable to the current state of the art for this problem domain. Future work includes performing a fitness landscape analysis and potential development of new genetic operators.</p>

        <p>Metaheuristics are a fairly standard approach for solving optimisation problems due to their success, flexibility, and simplicity. However, there is a plethora of metaheuristics available, with different performance levels for various problems. This work proposes a methodology for designing heuristic-based procedures to solve continuous optimisation problems and study how the population size affects its performance. The technique comprises the well-known Simulated Annealing algorithm as a hyper-heuristic, and a heuristic sequence taken from unfolding the conventional scheme of population-based metaheuristics reported in the literature. Our results show that the proposed approach is a reliable alternative for tackling optimisation problems. We find exciting insights, according to our data, about this primary implementation when varying the population size in different challenging problems.</p>

        <p>Video quality assessment (VQA) methods have many applications in compression technologies, video transmission planning, and monitoring quality of service. Netflix has recently developed an open-source, state-of-the-art VQA method called video multi-methods assessment fusion (VMAF) which proved to correlate well with the human judgments of perceptual quality of videos. VMAF is designed manually by human experts. To our knowledge, no prior study has been conducted to automate the design of VMAF. In this paper, we propose a simulated annealing search (SA) and a genetic algorithm (GA) to search the space of VMAF configurations. We used the Netflix public dataset and the LIVE-VQA dataset to evaluate the proposed approaches. It is found that both SA and the GA improve the design of VMAF with the GA being the superior method.</p>

        <p>The book has presented current trends and state-of-the-art advancements in the automated design of machine learning and search algorithms. In this context, we define automated design(AutoDes) to include automated algorithm/approach configuration, composition, and selection. This chapter provides a conclusion to the book by bringing together these contributions, highlighting different focus areas, and setting the agenda for future research directions. This is presented in terms of reusability in automated design, explainable automated design, computational costs, theoretical aspects, automated design standardization, and semi-automated design.</p>

        <p>This chapter presents a newly defined novel combinatorial optimisation problem, namely, the General Combinatorial Optimisation Problem (GCOP), whose decision variables are a set of elementary algorithm components. The combinations of these algorithm components, i.e. solutions of GCOP, thus represent different search algorithms. The objective of GCOP is to find the optimal combinations of algorithm components for solving optimisation problems. Solving the GCOP is thus equivalent to automatically designing the best search algorithms for optimisation problems. The definition of the GCOP is presented with a new taxonomy which categorises relevant literature on automated algorithm design into three lines of research, namely, automated algorithm configuration, selection and composition. Based on the decision space under consideration, the algorithm design itself is defined as an optimisation problem. Relevant literature is briefly reviewed, motivating a new line of exciting and challenging directions on the emerging research of automated algorithm design.</p>

        <p>The recent successes of artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning, for solving real-world problems have motivated the advances towards automated design of algorithms and systems with less human involvement. In machine learning and meta-heuristic search algorithms, different lines of relevant research are now emerging, with findings feeding into each other. This book presents a selection of some recent advances across automated machine learning (AutoML) and automated algorithm design (AutoAD), where the effectiveness and efficiency of techniques and algorithms has been enhanced with the support of new taxonomies, models, theories, as well as frameworks and benchmarks. The emerging new lines of exciting research directions in AutoML and AutoAD present new challenges across multiple research communities in machine learning, evolutionary computation and optimisation research.</p>

        <p>Many of the works conducted on algorithm selection strategies—methods that choose a suitable solving method for a particular problem—start from scratch since only a few investigations on reusable components of such methods are found in the literature. Additionally, researchers might unintentionally omit some implementation details when documenting the algorithm selection strategy. This makes it difficult for others to reproduce the behavior obtained by such an approach. To address these problems, we propose to rely on existing techniques from the Machine Learning realm to speed-up the generation of algorithm selection strategies while improving the modularity and reproducibility of the research. The proposed solution model is implemented on a domain-independent Machine Learning module that executes the core mechanism of the algorithm selection task. The algorithm selection strategies produced in this work are implemented and tested rapidly compared against the time it would take to build a similar approach from scratch. We produce four novel algorithm selectors based on Machine Learning for constraint satisfaction problems to verify our approach. Our data suggest that these algorithms outperform the best performing algorithm on a set of test instances. For example, the algorithm selectors Multiclass Neural Network (MNN) and Multiclass Logistic Regression (MLR), powered by a neural network and linear regression, respectively, reduced the search cost (in terms of consistency checks) of the best performing heuristic (KAPPA), on average, by 49% for the instances considered for this work.</p>

        <p>Crime generates significant losses, both human and economic. Every year, billions of dollars are lost due to attacks, crimes, and scams. Surveillance video camera networks generate vast amounts of data, and the surveillance staff cannot process all the information in real-time. Human sight has critical limitations. Among those limitations, visual focus is one of the most critical when dealing with surveillance. For example, in a surveillance room, a crime can occur in a different screen segment or on a distinct monitor, and the surveillance staff may overlook it. Our proposal focuses on shoplifting crimes by analyzing situations that an average person will consider as typical conditions, but may eventually lead to a crime. While other approaches identify the crime itself, we instead model suspicious behavior—the one that may occur before the build-up phase of a crime—by detecting precise segments of a video with a high probability of containing a shoplifting crime. By urlng so, we provide the staff with more opportunities to act and prevent crime. We implemented a 3DCNN model as a video feature extractor and tested its performance on a dataset composed of daily action and shoplifting samples. The results are encouraging as the model correctly classifies suspicious behavior in most of the scenarios where it was tested. For example, when classifying suspicious behavior, the best model generated in this work obtains precision and recall values of 0.8571 and 1 in one of the test scenarios, respectively.</p>

        <p>In this paper, we present the construction process of a per-instance algorithm selection model to improve the initial solutions of Curriculum-Based Course Timetabling (CB-CTT) instances. Following the meta-learning framework, we apply a hybrid approach that integrates the predictions of a classifier and linear regression models to estimate and compare the performance of four meta-heuristics across different problem sub-spaces described by seven types of features. Rather than reporting the average accuracy, we evaluate the model using the closed SBS-VBS gap, a performance measure used at international algorithm selection competitions. The experimental results show that our model obtains a performance of 0.386, within the range obtained by per-instance algorithm selection models in other combinatorial problems. As a result of the process, we conclude that the performance variation between the meta-heuristics has a significant role in the effectiveness of the model. Therefore, we introduce statistical analyses to evaluate this factor within per-instance algorithm portfolios.</p>

        <p>Hyperheuristics rise as powerful techniques that get good results in less computational time than exact methods like dynamic programming or branch and bound. These exact methods promise the global best solution, but with a high computational time. In this matter, hyperheuristics do not promise the global best solution, but they promise a good solution in a lot less computational time. On the contrary, fuzzy logic provides the tools to model complex problems in a more natural way. With this in mind, this paper proposes a fuzzy hyperheuristic approach, which is a combination of a fuzzy inference system with a selection hyperheuristic. The fuzzy system needs the optimization of its fuzzy rules due to the lack of expert knowledge; indeed, traditional hyperheuristics also need an optimization of their rules. The fuzzy rules are optimized by genetic algorithms, and for the rules of the traditional methods, we use particle swarm optimization. The genetic algorithm will also reduce the number of fuzzy rules, in order to find the best minimal fuzzy rules, whereas traditional methods already use very few rules. Experimental results show the advantage of using our approach instead of a traditional selection hyperheuristic in 3200 instances of the 0/1 knapsack problem.</p>

        <p>Artificial neural networks are efficient learning algorithms that are considered to be universal approximators for solving numerous real-world problems in areas such as computer vision, language processing, or reinforcement learning. To approximate any given function, neural networks train a large number of parameters—up to millions, or even billions in some cases. The large number of parameters and hidden layers in neural networks make them hard to interpret, which is why they are often referred to as black boxes. In the quest to make artificial neural networks interpretable in the field of computer vision, feature visualization stands out as one of the most developed and promising research directions. While feature visualizations are a valuable tool to gain insights about the underlying function learned by the network, they are still considered to be simple visual aids requiring human interpretation. In this paper, we propose that feature visualizations—class visualizations in particular—are analogous to mental imagery in humans, resembling the experience of seeing or perceiving the actual training data. Therefore, we propose that class visualizations contain embedded knowledge that can be exploited in a more automated manner. We present a series of experiments that shed light on the nature of class visualizations and demonstrate that class visualizations can be considered a conceptual compression of the data used to train the underlying model. Finally, we show that class visualizations can be regarded as convolutional filters and experimentally show their potential for extreme model compression purposes.</p>

        <p>Video Retrieval is a challenging task where a text query is matched to a video or vice versa. Most of the existing approaches for addressing such a problem rely on annotations made by the users. Although simple, this approach is not always feasible in practice. In this work, we explore the application of the language-image model, CLIP, to obtain video representations without the need for said annotations. This model was explicitly trained to learn a common space where images and text can be compared. Using various techniques described in this document, we extended its application to videos, obtaining state-of-the-art results on the MSR-VTT and MSVD benchmarks.</p>

        <p>Literature is prolific with metaheuristics for solving continuous optimisation problems. But, in practice, it is difficult to choose one appropriately for several reasons. First and foremost, ‘new’ metaheuristics are being proposed at an alarmingly fast rate, rendering impossible to know them all. Moreover, it is necessary to determine a good enough set of parameters for the selected approach. Hence, this work proposes a strategy based on a hyper-heuristic model powered by Simulated Annealing for customising population-based metaheuristics. Our approach considers search operators from 10 well-known techniques as building blocks for new ones. We test this strategy on 107 continuous benchmark functions and in up to 50 dimensions. Besides, we analyse the performance of our approach under different experimental conditions. The resulting data reveal that it is possible to obtain good-performing metaheuristics with diverse configurations for each case of study and in an automatic fashion. In this way, we validate the potential of the proposed framework for devising metaheuristics that solve continuous optimisation problems with different characteristics, similar to those from practical engineering scenarios.</p>

        <p>Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in automatic learning mechanisms and applications. The concept of hyper-heuristics, algorithms that either select among existing algorithms or generate new ones, holds high relevance in this matter. Current research suggests that, under certain circumstances, hyper-heuristics outperform single heuristics when evaluated in isolation. When hyper-heuristics are selected among existing algorithms, they map problem states into suitable solvers. Unfortunately, identifying the features that accurately describe the problem state—and thus allow for a proper mapping—requires plenty of domain-specific knowledge, which is not always available. This work proposes a simple yet effective hyper-heuristic model that does not rely on problem features to produce such a mapping. The model defines a fixed sequence of heuristics that improves the solving process of knapsack problems. This research comprises an analysis of feature-independent hyper-heuristic performance under different learning conditions and different problem sets.</p>

        <p>Although the number of solutions in combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) is finite, some problems grow exponentially and render exact approaches unfeasible. So, approximate methods, such as heuristics, are customary. Each heuristic usually specializes in specific kinds of problems. Hence, other approaches seek to merge their strengths. One of them is selection hyper-heuristics. However, they usually provide scarce information about their sensitivity. Illumination algorithms may fix this issue since they focus on exploration rather than exploitation while preserving the best solutions under different criteria. Still, literature falls short when merging both approaches, representing a knowledge gap. This work tests the feasibility of using an illumination algorithm, MAP-Elites (ME), for tuning a sequence-based selection hyper-heuristic model for Balanced Partition problems. We choose ME since other researchers have successfully applied it to a different COP. So, we may achieve a hyper-heuristic that represents the best combination of heuristics while simultaneously gaining intel on the performance of diverse alternatives. Our approach operates by creating a multi-dimensional map, where each design variable represents the application of a heuristic. Afterward, ME generates mutated sequences and tests them to determine if they represent a better-performing solution. We consider 1500 instances that include easy and hard instances, analyzed under different scenarios to test our approach. We also include limit instances that are neither easy nor hard. Our resulting data support the proposed approach, as it performs toe-to-toe with a synthetic oracle and may even outperform it. This represents an outstanding result, since a brute-force approach is needed to achieve such an oracle. So, merging ME and hyper-heuristics is a path worth pursuing. We also present how each parameter affects the model performance and identify the critical and virtually irrelevant ones. This serves as the groundwork for future works that focus on exploiting the most relevant parameters.</p>

        <p>Optimization is a field that never runs out nor becomes irrelevant. Nowadays, it is pretty hard to find a solver from the overpopulation of metaheuristics that properly deals with a given problem. This is even considered an additional problem. In this work, we propose a novel and simple methodology for solving the Metaheuristic Composition Optimization Problem, which involves designing heuristic-based procedures that solve continuous optimization problems. This methodology implements a naı́ve online learning that identifies the most relevant search operators to include in the candidate heuristic-based procedures. For representing these procedures, we adopt our previously proposed unfolded metaheuristic model. We prove the feasibility of this approach via a two-fold experiment employing several continuous optimization problems. Our data revealed that the learning procedure is worthwhile, finding adequate solutions for problems in up to 50 dimensions.</p>

        <p>Problem instances are paramount when testing the performance of any learning algorithm. For this reason, it is customary to use widespread problems known as benchmark instances. Nonetheless, these are usually generated disregarding heuristics and their nature. For Job Shop Scheduling problem, researchers have created such instances based on random distributions. This idea may bias conclusions about the algorithm under test since a practitioner can only observe performance from a limited perspective, which may not even reflect real-life situations. However, addressing this issue implies tackling the instance generation problem while considering the nature of the solution approach. Hence, in this work, we propose an instance generator based on the Unified Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, which can tailor instances to different goals. To validate our approach, we include instances generated to different heuristics and instances tailored to a variety of features. In the first case, we seek to favor or hinder one heuristic whereas urlng the opposite for the remaining ones. In the second one, we explore instances with specific feature values. Our data reveal that the proposed approach fulfills the expectations and can effectively deal with different kinds of instances. We analyse the nature of the generated instances and their insights, which can be used to further the study about heuristics and problem features.</p>

        <p>Optimisation has been with us since before the first humans opened their eyes to natural phenomena that inspire technological progress. Nowadays, it is quite hard to find a solver from the overpopulation of metaheuristics that properly deals with a given problem. This is even considered an additional problem. In this work, we propose a heuristic-based solver model for continuous optimisation problems by extending the existing concepts present in the literature. We name such solvers ‘unfolded’ metaheuristics (uMHs) since they comprise a heterogeneous sequence of simple heuristics obtained from delegating the control operator in the standard metaheuristic scheme to a high-level strategy. Therefore, we tackle the Metaheuristic Composition Optimisation Problem by tailoring a particular uMH that deals with a specific application. We prove the feasibility of this model via a two-fold experiment employing several continuous optimisation problems and a collection of diverse population-based operators with fixed dimensions from ten well-known metaheuristics in the literature. As a high-level strategy, we utilised a hyper-heuristic based on Simulated Annealing. Results demonstrate that our proposed approach represents a very reliable alternative with a low computational cost for tackling continuous optimisation problems with a tailored metaheuristic using a set of agents. We also study the implication of several parameters involved in the uMH model and their influence over the solver performance.</p>

        <p>Many of the core disciplines of artificial intelligence have sets of standard benchmark problems well known and widely used by the community when developing new algorithms. Constraint programming and automated planning are examples of these areas, where the behaviour of a new algorithm is measured by how it performs on these instances. Typically the efficiency of each solving method varies not only between problems, but also between instances of the same problem. Therefore, having a diverse set of instances is crucial to be able to effectively evaluate a new solving method. Current methods for automatic generation of instances for Constraint Programming problems start with a declarative model and search for instances with some desired attributes, such as hardness or size. We first explore the difficulties of adapting this approach to generate instances starting from problem specifications written in PDDL, the de-facto standard language of the automated planning community. We then propose a new approach where the whole planning problem description is modelled using Essence, an abstract modelling language that allows expressing high-level structures without committing to a particular low level representation in PDDL.</p>

        <p>Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the sub-field of machine learning that aims at automating, to some extend, all stages of the design of a machine learning system. In the context of supervised learning, AutoML is concerned with feature extraction, pre processing, model design and post processing. Major contributions and achievements in AutoML have been taking place during the recent decade. We are therefore in perfect timing to look back and realize what we have learned. This chapter aims to summarize the main findings in the early years of AutoML. More specifically, in this chapter an introduction to AutoML for supervised learning is provided and an historical review of progress in this field is presented. Likewise, the main paradigms of AutoML are described and research opportunities are outlined.</p>

        <p>Recently, there has been increased research on adaptive control systems for vehicles that operate on autonomous vehicle only roads. Specifically, roads without current infrastructure constraints of traffic lights, stop signals at intersections or vehicle lanes. This study investigates controller automation for vehicles that must navigate and coordinate with each other on such autonomous vehicle only roads. We comparatively evaluate fitness-function (objective) versus behavior-based (novelty search) versus hybridized objective-novelty evolutionary search for synthesizing autonomous vehicle coordinated driving behavior. The goal of such evolved coordinated driving behavior is to maximize effective (safe) and efficient (expedient) autonomous vehicle traffic throughput for given roads. Results indicate that while novelty and hybrid search evolved effective and efficient driving behaviors, these behaviors did not generalize to new roads as well as driving behaviors evolved with objective-based search.</p>

        <p>This paper presents an experimental comparison among four Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) methods for recommending the best classification algorithm for a given input dataset. Three of these methods are based on Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), and the other is Auto-WEKA, a well-known AutoML method based on the Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyper-parameter optimisation (CASH) approach. The EA-based methods build classification algorithms from a single machine learning paradigm: either decision-tree induction, rule induction, or Bayesian network classification. Auto-WEKA combines algorithm selection and hyper-parameter optimisation to recommend classification algorithms from multiple paradigms. We performed controlled experiments where these four AutoML methods were given the same runtime limit for different values of this limit. In general, the difference in predictive accuracy of the three best AutoML methods was not statistically significant. However, the EA evolving decision-tree induction algorithms has the advantage of producing algorithms that generate interpretable classification models and that are more scalable to large datasets, by comparison with many algorithms from other learning paradigms that can be recommended by Auto-WEKA. We also observed that Auto-WEKA has shown meta-overfitting, a form of overfitting at the meta-learning level, rather than at the base-learning level.</p>

        <p>Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has emerged to deal with the selection and configuration of algorithms for a given learning task. With the progression of AutoML, several effective methods were introduced, especially for traditional classification and regression problems. Apart from the AutoML success, several issues remain open. One issue, in particular, is the lack of ability of AutoML methods to deal with different types of data. Based on this scenario, this paper approaches AutoML for multi-label classification (MLC) problems. In MLC, each example can be simultaneously associated to several class labels, unlike the standard classification task, where an example is associated to just one class label. In this work, we provide a general comparison of five automated multi-label classification methods - two evolutionary methods, one Bayesian optimization method, one random search and one greedy search - on 14 datasets and three designed search spaces. Overall, we observe that the most prominent method is the one based on a canonical grammar-based genetic programming (GGP) search method, namely Auto-MEKAGGP. Auto-MEKAGGP presented the best average results in our comparison and was statistically better than all the other methods in different search spaces and evaluated measures, except when compared to the greedy search method.</p>

        <p>This paper defines a new combinatorial optimization problem, namely General Combinatorial Optimization Problem (GCOP), whose decision variables are a set of parametric algorithmic components, i.e. algorithm design decisions. The solutions of GCOP, i.e. compositions of algorithmic components, thus represent different generic search algorithms. The objective of GCOP is to find the optimal algorithmic compositions for solving the given optimization problems. Solving the GCOP is thus equivalent to automatically designing the best algorithms for optimization problems. Despite recent advances, the evolutionary computation and optimization research communities are yet to embrace formal standards that underpin automated algorithm design. In this position paper, we establish GCOP as a new standard to define different search algorithms within one unified model. We demonstrate the new GCOP model to standardize various search algorithms as well as selection hyperheuristics. A taxonomy is defined to distinguish several widely used terminologies in automated algorithm design, namely automated algorithm composition, configuration and selection. We would like to encourage a new line of exciting research directions addressing several challenging research issues including algorithm generality, algorithm reusability, and automated algorithm design.</p>

        <p>Hyper-heuristics represent an innovative method for solving hard combinatorial problems such as the Bin Packing Problem. In this work, we propose a solution model that incorporates insights from unsupervised learning to produce solvers that base their decisions on maximizing a reward. The solution model takes the form of a hyper-heuristic. As the search progresses, this strategy chooses among different heuristics, adapting the solution process to the current problem state under exploration. The proposed model relies on the k-means clustering algorithm to identify the centroids of what we define as “action regions” (regions where we can recommend one particular heuristic). To recommend a heuristic in such action regions, we use a simple yet useful reward-based approach that analyzes the performance of individual heuristics. Then, the hyper-heuristic (a collection of action regions) decides which heuristic is the most suitable one to apply given one specific problem state. The experimental setup was carried out on a total of 580 bin packing instances with promising results.</p>

        <p>The Job-Shop Scheduling Problem represents a challenging field of study due to its NP-Hard nature. Its many industrial and practical, real-world applications skyrocket its importance. Particularly, hyper-heuristics have attracted the attention of researchers on this topic due to their promising results in this, and other optimization problems. A hyper-heuristic is a method that determines which heuristic to apply at each step while solving a problem. This investigation aims at rendering hyper-heuristics by combining unsupervised and reinforcement learning techniques. The proposed solution applies a clustering approach over the feature space, and then, it generates knowledge about heuristic selection through a reward-based system. Results show that our hyper-heuristics surmount competent heuristics, such as SPT and MRT, in various test instances. Besides, some of these hyper-heuristics outperformed the best result obtained among all the heuristics in more than 33% of the instances. Hence, we believe that the proposed approach is promising and that more knowledge about its benefits and limitations should be derived through its application on different problems.</p>

        <p>Literature is prolific with metaheuristics for solving continuous optimisation problems. But, in practice, it is difficult to choose one appropriately. Moreover, it is necessary to determine a good enough set of parameters for the selected approach. Hence, this work proposes a strategy based on a hyper-heuristic for tailoring population-based metaheuristics. Besides, our approach considers search operators from well-known techniques as building blocks for new ones. We test this strategy through four benchmark functions and by varying their dimensions. We obtain metaheuristics with diverse configurations. We observe a possible performance boost when two or more search operators are considered. This could be due to previously unexplored interactions between such operators.</p>

        <p>This study presents an offline learning Simulated Annealing approach to generate a constructive hyper-heuristic evaluated through training and testing on a set of instances for solving the Job-Shop Scheduling problem. The generated hyperheuristic uses a range of state features to control a set of low-level constructive heuristics. A hyper-heuristic is represented in terms of a set of rules, where each rule contains a fixed set of values for the features in consideration and the low level heuristic to be invoked. At each constructive step, the ‘closest’ rule is selected and then the corresponding constructive low level heuristic is applied. Our distance metric is the Euclidean distance between the values within the rule and the state features characterising the partial schedule along with the remaining jobs to be scheduled for the partial solution. In this paper, we study a set of features computed with various well-known metrics and different feature transformation methods for improving the characterization of the problem instances and solutions to Job-Shop Scheduling as a part of our approach. Eight different scenarios are evaluated on a set of randomly generated problem instances. Each scenario represents a distinct approach combining a different feature transformation applied during the training and testing phases. The empirical results show that transformations can improve the spread of feature values and the choice of the transformation methods is influential on the performance of the overall approach. A particular choice generates a slightly better performance when compared to the standard approach, which uses the original features at all times, indicating the potential of the proposed approach for the future studies.</p>

        <p>Metaheuristics have become a widely used approach for solving a variety of practical problems. The literature is full of diverse metaheuristics based on outstanding ideas and with proven excellent capabilities. Nonetheless, oftentimes metaheuristics claim novelty when they are just recombining elements from other methods. Hence, the need for a standard metaheuristic model is vital to stop the current frenetic tendency of proposing methods chiefly based on their inspirational source. This work introduces a first step to a generalised and mathematically formal metaheuristic model, which can be used for studying and improving them. This model is based on a scheme of simple heuristics, which perform as building blocks that can be modified depending on the application. For this purpose, we define and detail all components and concepts of a metaheuristic (i.e., its search operators), such as heuristics. Furthermore, we also provide some ideas to take into account for exploring other search operator configurations in the future. To illustrate the proposed model, we analyse search operators from four well-known metaheuristics employed in continuous optimisation problems as a proof-of-concept. From them, we derive 20 different approaches and use them for solving some benchmark functions with different landscapes. Data show the remarkable capability of our methodology for building metaheuristics and detecting which operator to choose depending on the problem to solve. Moreover, we outline and discuss several future extensions of this model to various problem and solver domains.</p>

        <p>Hyper-heuristics aim at interchanging different solvers while solving a problem. The idea is to determine the best approach for solving a problem at its current state. This way, every time we make a move it gets us closer to a solution. The problem changes; so does its state. As a consequence, for the next move, a different solver may be invoked. Hyper-heuristics have been around for almost 20 years. However, combinatorial optimization problems date from way back. Thus, it is paramount to determine whether the efforts revolving around hyper-heuristic research have been targeted at the problems of the highest interest for the combinatorial optimization community. In this work, we tackle such an endeavor. We begin by determining the most relevant combinatorial optimization problems, and then we analyze them in the context of hyper-heuristics. The idea is to verify whether they remain as relevant when considering exclusively works related to hyper-heuristics. We find that some of the most relevant problem domains have also been popular for hyper-heuristics research. Alas, others have not and few efforts have been directed towards solving them. We identify the following problem domains, which may help in furthering the impact of hyper-heuristics: Shortest Path, Set Cover, Longest Path, and Minimum Spanning Tree. We believe that focusing research on ways for solving them may lead to an increase in the relevance and impact that hyper-heuristics have on combinatorial optimization problems.</p>

        <p>This paper presents a strategy of state-of-the-art review of artificial intelligence (AI) in education and a case study about preparing students to have the competencies and skills necessary for the current and future digital transformation to Industry 4.0. The goal is to support institutions of higher education to build curricula that help companies by providing them with qualified human capital to face the challenges of the twenty first century that have brought about the work environment now referred to as Industry 4.0 or the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The strategy consists of a business intelligence summary of AI trends and challenges of interest to academic institutions with an emphasis in intelligent human–computer communication and interactive design and manufacturing for educating engineers for the future enterprise. We also present a case study that builds upon 35 years of experience in offering AI academic programs in the institution, Tecnologico de Monterrey (Tec) to educate future engineers and knowledge workers. The components of our case study comprise graduate and undergraduate courses, research, internships, innovation, internationalization initiatives, and entrepreneurship. In this period, more than 5200 students have been trained at the Ph.D., MSc, and undergraduate levels with intense use of technology in the AI field. Now, the curricula of the university have been overhauled and renewed according to a new educative model known as the Tec21 Educative Model. The course offerings under this model are structured with challenge-based-learning, physical and virtual practice labs, and mixed teaching methodologies to accommodate the digital transformation and demands of Industry 4.0 to educate and prepare the new generation of students. The strategy and case study presented may be useful guides for other higher education institutions implementing AI academic programs to educate students demanded by the companies of the XXI century.</p>

        <p>Hyper-heuristics are potent techniques that represent the synergy of low-level heuristics when solving optimization problems. This synergy usually leads to better solutions. Similarly, fuzzy logic has been successfully applied to several domains, thanks to the expert knowledge it encompasses. Thus, combining the benefits of both approaches should lead to a more reliable and effective method. Hence, in this work, we propose a fuzzy-based selection hyper-heuristic model. We considered seven features and four low-level heuristics, which represent the inputs and output of the fuzzy inference system, respectively. Each input was defined with two membership functions. Since there is no expert knowledge available, we lay out all the rules (128) and use a genetic algorithm to find optimum values for the consequents of these rules. In other words, the genetic algorithm will evolve the rules of the fuzzy inference system until it become an expert, and will then save such knowledge as the set of fuzzy rules. The main concern of this paper is to find out if a fuzzy inference system can help to get better results in the inner working of a hyperheuristic. To prove this, we make a comparison between a fuzzy hyper-heuristic model optimized by a genetic algorithm against three traditional selection hyper-heuristic models (with a different number of rules) optimized by a particle swarm optimization method. We applied all these methods using the same set of low-level heuristics to solve an 800 instance set of the 0-1 Knapsack problem as a testbed.</p>

        <p>There is a colourful palette of metaheuristics for solving continuous optimisation problems in the literature. Unfortunately, it is not easy to pick a suitable one for a specific practical scenario. Moreover, oftentimes the selected metaheuristic must be tuned until finding adequate parameter settings. Therefore, this work presents a framework based on a hyper-heuristic powered by Simulated Annealing for tailoring population-based metaheuristics. To do so, we recognise search operators from well-known techniques as building blocks for new ones. The presented framework comprises six main modules coded in Python, which can be used independently, and which help explore new metaheuristics.</p>

        <p>Recent years have witnessed an escalating interest for methods that automatically adapt to different types of problems. In this regard, the term hyper-heuristics–heuristics that either select or generate new heuristics–is a relevant concept. Experimental evidence supports the idea that hyperheuristics can outperform single, isolated heuristics. However, commonly used hyper-heuristic models require several inputs. One of them is a set of features that accurately characterize the instances, which limits their applicability. Thus, in this work, we analyze how to implement a simple evolutionary algorithm to produce feature-independent hyper-heuristics. We compare its performance against that of simple heuristics, for the domain of the knapsack problem. Our research focuses on two elements: performance and frequency. In the former, we analyze how the performance of the learning stage varies across different scenarios. In the latter, we examine how frequently heuristics interact within the hyper-heuristic. We show that the proposed hyper-heuristic model solves most of the instances considered in this work. Moreover, it does so more efficiently than isolated heuristics. At the same time, the model offers a straightforward parameter setting and requires little or no problem characterization, which simplifies its use on new problem domains.</p>

        <p>Suspicious behavior is likely to threaten security, assets, life, or freedom. This behavior has no particular pattern, which complicates the tasks to detect it and define it. Even for human observers, it is complex to spot suspicious behavior in surveillance videos. Some proposals to tackle abnormal and suspicious behavior-related problems are available in the literature. However, they usually suffer from high false-positive rates due to different classes with high visual similarity. The Pre-Crime Behavior method removes information related to a crime commission to focus on suspicious behavior before the crime happens. The resulting samples from different types of crime have a high-visual similarity with normal-behavior samples. To address this problem, we implemented 3D Convolutional Neural Networks and trained them under different approaches. Also, we tested different values in the number-of-filter parameter to optimize computational resources. Finally, the comparison between the performance using different training approaches shows the best option to improve the suspicious behavior detection on surveillance videos.</p>

        <p>Deep interactive evolution (DeepIE) combines the capacity of interactive evolutionary computation (IEC) to capture a user’s preference with the domain-specific robustness of a trained generative adversarial network (GAN) generator, allowing the user to control the GAN output through evolutionary exploration of the latent space. However, the traditional GAN latent space presents feature entanglement, which limits the practicability of possible applications of DeepIE. In this paper, we implement DeepIE within a style-based generator from a StyleGAN model trained on the WikiArt dataset and propose StyleIE, a variation of DeepIE that takes advantage of the secondary disentangled latent space in the style-based generator. We performed two AB/BA crossover user tests that compared the performance of DeepIE against StyleIE for art generation. Self-rated evaluations of the performance were collected through a questionnaire. Findings from the tests suggest that StyleIE and DeepIE perform equally in tasks with open-ended goals with relaxed constraints, but StyleIE performs better in close-ended and more constrained tasks.</p>

        <p>Deep neural networks have been able to outperform humans in some cases like image recognition and image classification. However, with the emergence of various novel categories, the ability to continuously widen the learning capability of such networks from limited samples, still remains a challenge. Techniques like Meta-Learning and/or few-shot learning showed promising results, where they can learn or generalize to a novel category/task based on prior knowledge. In this paper, we perform a study of the existing few-shot meta-learning techniques in the computer vision domain based on their method and evaluation metrics. We provide a taxonomy for the techniques and categorize them as data-augmentation, embedding, optimization and semantics based learning for few-shot, one-shot and zero-shot settings. We then describe the seminal work done in each category and discuss their approach towards solving the predicament of learning from few samples. Lastly we provide a comparison of these techniques on the commonly used benchmark datasets: Omniglot, and MiniImagenet, along with a discussion towards the future direction of improving the performance of these techniques towards the final goal of outperforming humans.</p>

        <p>The present study tested the combination of an established and a validated food-choice research method (the ‘fake food buffet’) with a new food-matching technology to automate the data collection and analysis. The methodology combines fake-food image recognition using deep learning and food matching and standardization based on natural language processing. The former is specific because it uses a single deep learning network to perform both the segmentation and the classification at the pixel level of the image. To assess its performance, measures based on the standard pixel accuracy and Intersection over Union were applied. Food matching firstly describes each of the recognized food items in the image and then matches the food items with their compositional data, considering both their food names and their descriptors. The final accuracy of the deep learning model trained on fake-food images acquired by 124 study participants and providing fifty-five food classes was 92·18 %, while the food matching was performed with a classification accuracy of 93 %. The present findings are a step towards automating dietary assessment and food-choice research. The methodology outperforms other approaches in pixel accuracy, and since it is the first automatic solution for recognizing the images of fake foods, the results could be used as a baseline for possible future studies. As the approach enables a semi-automatic description of recognized food items (e.g. with respect to FoodEx2), these can be linked to any food composition database that applies the same classification and description system.</p>

        <p>The ChaLearn AutoML Challenge (The authors are in alphabetical order of last name, except the first author who did most of the writing and the second author who produced most of the numerical analyses and plots.) (NIPS 2015 – ICML 2016) consisted of six rounds of a machine learning competition of progressive difficulty, subject to limited computational resources. It was followed bya one-round AutoML challenge (PAKDD 2018). The AutoML setting differs from former model selection/hyper-parameter selection challenges, such as the one we previously organized for NIPS 2006: the participants aim to develop fully automated and computationally efficient systems, capable of being trained and tested without human intervention, with code submission. This chapter analyzes the results of these competitions and provides details about the datasets, which were not revealed to the participants. The solutions of the winners are systematically benchmarked over all datasets of all rounds and compared with canonical machine learning algorithms available in scikit-learn. All materials discussed in this chapter (data and code) have been made publicly available at http://automl.chalearn.org/.</p>

        <p>Recent advances in AutoML have led to automated tools that can compete with machine learning experts on supervised learning tasks. In this work, we present two versions of Auto-Net, which provide automatically-tuned deep neural networks without any human intervention. The first version, Auto-Net 1.0, builds upon ideas from the competition-winning system Auto-sklearn by using the Bayesian Optimization method SMAC and uses Lasagne as the underlying deep learning (DL) library. The more recent Auto-Net 2.0 builds upon a recent combination of Bayesian Optimization and HyperBand, called BOHB, and uses PyTorch as DL library. To the best of our knowledge, Auto-Net 1.0 was the first automatically-tuned neural network to win competition datasets against human experts (as part of the first AutoML challenge). Further empirical results show that ensembling Auto-Net 1.0 with Auto-sklearn can perform better than either approach alone, and that Auto-Net 2.0 can perform better yet.</p>

        <p>This paper presents a study on methods for body-brain (behavior-morphology) co-evolution in a collective evolutionary robotics system. We investigate a neuro-evolution developmental encoding method designed for the co-evolution of robot behavior-morphology couplings. This behavior-morphology evolution method is evaluated across increasingly complex (difficult) collective behavior task environments. This is in comparison to controller evolution within pre-engineered robot morphologies (sensory configurations). Task-complexity is equated with the degree of cooperation required in collective robotics tasks. Results indicate that the developmental method produces significantly more effective behavior-morphology couplings, compared to those evolved with direct encoding methods and controllers evolved within fixed morphologies. These results suggest that such developmental encoding methods could serve as a general evolutionary simulation design tool for automating collective robotic designs. An end goal is for such collective robotic system designs to be rapidly prototyped and deployed in the physical task environments for which they were evolved.</p>

        <p>Perturbative heuristics, or move operators, are domain specific operators generally used with search techniques, for example the 2-opt operator for the travelling salesman problem. These operators are usually derived manually which is an extremely time consuming task. The study presented in this paper investigates automating this process focussing on deriving perturbative heuristics for discrete optimization problems. This research forms part of a larger initiative aimed at automating the design of machine learning and search techniques. While there has been some research on the automated generation of perturbative operators, this has not been a well researched domain and most work has focussed on recombining existing human derived perturbative heuristics or components thereof together with move acceptance criteria rather than producing new perturbative heuristics from scratch. In this research pertubative heuristics are defined in terms of basic actions and solution components. Grammatical evolution is used to combine the basic actions and solution components into perturbative heuristics. The performance of the generated heuristics is compared to human derived heuristics for two problems, namely, examination timetabling (ITC 2007 benchmark instances) and capacitated vehicle routing (Christofides and Golden instances). For both problems the generated perturbative heuristics outperformed the human derived heuristics. Given the potential of the automated generation of perturbative heuristics established in this study, future work will extend the this work by including conditional and iterative constructs in the perturbative heuristics as well as applying the approach to other problems.</p>

        <p>Hybrid metaheuristics have proven to be effective at solving complex real-world problems. However, designing hybrid metaheuristics is extremely time consuming and requires expert knowledge of the different metaheuristics that are hybridized. In previous work, the effectiveness of automating the design of relay hybrid metaheuristics has been established. A genetic algorithm was used to determine the sequence of hybridized metaheuristics and the parameters of the metaheuristics in the hybrid. This study extends this idea by automating the design of each metaheuristic involved in the hybridization in addition to automating the design of the hybridization. A template is specified for each metaheuristic, defining the metaheuristic in terms of components. Manual design of metaheuristics usually involves determining the components of the metaheuristic. In this study, a genetic algorithm is employed to determine the components and parameters for each metaheuristic as well as the sequence of hybridized metaheuristics. The proposed genetic algorithm approach was evaluated by using it to automatically design hybrid metaheuristics for two problem domains, namely, the aircraft landing problem and the two-dimensional bin packing problem. The automatically designed hybrid metaheuristics were found to perform competitively to state-of-the-art hybridized metaheuristics for both problems. Future research will extend these ideas by looking at automating the derivation of metaheuristic algorithms without predefined structures specified by the templates.</p>

        <p>Job Shop Scheduling problems (JSSPs) have become increasingly popular due to their application in supply chain systems. Several solution approaches have appeared in the literature. One of them is the use of low-level heuristics. These methods approximate a solution but only work well on some kind of problems. Hence, combining them may improve performance. In this paper, we use the classical stochastic local optimization algorithm Simulated Annealing to train a selection hyper-heuristic for solving JSSPs. To do so, we use an instance generator provided in literature to create training sets with a different number of instances: 20, 40, and 60. In addition, we select instances from the literature to create two test scenarios, one similar to the training instances, and another with bigger problems. Our results suggest that training with the highest number of instances lead to better and more stable hyper-heuristics. For example, in the first test scenario, we achieved a reduction in the data range of over 60% and an improvement in the median performance of almost 30%. Moreover, under these conditions about 75% of the generated hyper-heuristics were able to perform equal to or better than the best heuristic. Even so, less than 25% were able to outperform the synthetic Oracle. Because of the aforementioned, we strongly support the idea of using a selection hyper-heuristic model powered by Simulated Annealing for creating a high-level solver for Job Shop Scheduling problems.</p>

        <p>The assessment of strengths and weaknesses of a solver is often limited by the diversity of the cases where it is tested upon. As such, it is paramount to have a versatile tool which finds the problem instances where such a solver excels/fails. In this manuscript, we propose to use an evolutionary algorithm for creating this tool. To validate our approach, we conducted several tests on four heuristics for the knapsack problem. Although, the process can be extended to other domains with relatively few changes. The tests cover different sets of instances, both favoring the performance of one heuristic while hindering that of the remaining ones, and vice versa. To further test our evolutionary-based model, we also apply it on a recent approach that combines the strengths of different heuristics to improve its performance (usually referred to as a hyper-heuristic). We show that it is possible to tailor instances in which even this more complex model excels/fails. Throughout our approach, a researcher can test a solver under different kinds of scenarios, delving deeper into the conditions that make it perform well/poorly. Therefore, we recommend using the proposed approach as a means to grasp better insights about strengths and weaknesses of different solvers.</p>

        <p>Hyper-heuristics stand as a novel tool that combines low-level heuristics into robust solvers. However, training cost is a drawback that hinders their applicability. In this work, we analyze the effect of training with different problem sizes, to determine whether an effective simplification can be made. We train selection hyper-heuristics for the Job Shop Scheduling problem through Simulated Annealing. Results from preliminary experiments suggest that the aforementioned simplification is feasible. To better understand such an effect, we carry out experiments training on two different instance sizes, 5 × 5 and 15×15, while testing on instances of size 15 × 15. Our data show that hyper-heuristics trained in small-sized instances perform similarly to those trained in larger problems. Thus, we discuss a possible explanation for this effect.</p>

        <p>This research describes three novel heuristic-based approaches for solving the 0/1 knapsack problem. The knapsack problem, in its many variants, arises in many practical scenarios such as the selection of investment projects and budget control. As an NP-hard problem, it is not always possible to compute the optimal solution by using exact methods and, for this reason, the problem is usually solved by using heuristic-based strategies. In this document, we use information of the distributions of weight and profit of the items in the knapsack instances to design and implement new heuristic-based methods that solve those instances. The solution model proposed in this work is two-fold: the first part focuses on the generation of two new heuristics, while the second explores the combination of solving methods through a hyper-heuristic approach. The heuristics proposed, as well as the hyper-heuristic model, were tested on a heterogeneous set of knapsack problem instances and compared against four heuristics taken from the literature. One of the proposed heuristics proved to be highly competent with respect to heuristics available in the literature. By using the hyper-heuristic, a solver that dynamically selects heuristics based on the problem features, we improved the results obtained by the new heuristics proposed and, achieved the best results among all the methods tested in this investigation.</p>

        <p>This paper describes a method for solving vehicle routing problems with time windows, based on selecting meta-heuristics via meta-learning. Although several meta-heuristics already exist that can obtain good overall results on some vehicle routing problem instances, none of them performs well in all cases. By defining a set of meta-features that appropriately characterize different routing problem instances and using a suitable classifier, our model can often correctly predict the best meta-heuristic for each instance. The main contributions of this paper are the definition of two meta-feature sets, one based on what we call ’basic’ instance properties and another based on the number of feasible solutions found by perturbative heuristics via a greedy process. We use a multilayer perceptron classifier, combined with a wrapper meta-feature selection method, to predict the most suitable meta-heuristic to apply to a given problem instance. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve upon the overall performance of well-known meta-heuristics in the field. Therefore, this paper proposes to store, share and exploit in an off-line scheme the solutions obtained in instances of different scenarios such as the academy or industry, with the aim of predicting good solvers for new instances when necessary.</p>

        <p>It is common to find that training of selection hyper-heuristics is done perturbatively. The process usually starts with a random selection module and iterates over a set of instances until finding appropriate values for such module. In this work, however, we present a model for creating selection hyper-heuristics constructively. To achieve so, we use a set of instances evolved for such a task. For each low-level heuristic, we evolved a set of problem instances that are more easily solvable by that particular heuristic (compared to the other ones). Each group contains instances easily solvable with the corresponding heuristic but not with the remaining ones. Thus, our model creates its selector by calculating the centroid of each group. For urlng so, the model defines a rule that maps said centroid to one corresponding action (in this case, a low-level heuristic). To test our approach, we select the one-dimensional Bin Packing Problem and set four target performance levels (which we refer to as deltas) for instance generation. Then, we analyze all the possible combinations of deltas. We study how performance of the generated hyper-heuristics shift when they are created using a different number of instances. Our data shows the feasibility of creating a hyper-heuristic under the stated conditions. Effectiveness of the model depends on the deltas used though we observed that higher deltas are useful while lower deltas are not. For example, when considering a delta level of 2.0, our method produced hyper-heuristics with an accumulated average waste 12% lower than that of the best heuristic. But, for a delta level of 0.5, it became impossible to outperform the heuristics.</p>

        <p>Models of seriesparallel (SP) photovoltaic (PV) generators under nonhomogeneous conditions commonly represent each submodule with the single-diode model. However, most of those models require high calculation burdens because they need to evaluate the LambertW function for each submodule in the generator to calculate the submodule current as a function of its voltage. This paper proposes a model for SP generators, operating under nonhomogeneous conditions, which uses the implicit currentvoltage relation of each submodule to propose a system of nonlinear equations that describes the electrical behavior of an SP generator. The generator can be divided into strings, which are analyzed independently since they are parallel connected. Each string is composed of \N submodules and one blocking diode connected in series; hence, the model has \N+2 unknown: \N+1 voltages of the submodules and the blocking diode, and the string current. The system of \N+2 nonlinear equations is formed by the \N implicit currentvoltage relationships of the submodules, the blocking diode model, and the Kirchhoff’s voltage law applied to the string. The system of nonlinear equations can be solved with the same numerical methods used by traditional models. The main advantage of the proposed model is the avoidance of evaluating the LambertW function, which reduces the computational burden and the calculation time. Moreover, simulation and experimental results show the feasibility of using implicit submodules currentvoltage relationships for models of PV generators, since it significantly reduces the calculation time with the same errors provided by traditional models.</p>

        <p>Service-oriented architecture (SOA) has been widely employed in the field of software engineering, since it encourages attributes such as modularity and code reusability across different applications. Web service composition, where atomic services that accomplish simple tasks are combined into an application that fulfils a more complex function, is one popular application of SOA. Existing composition works focus on building functional and quality-optimised applications. A subset of these works use multi-objective evolutionary computing techniques to produce a Pareto front of compositions, though they assume that the basic structure of the composition workflow is already known. In our recent work, we removed this assumption by combining NSGA-II with a solution representation that allows for different workflow structures to be investigated. However, the multi-objective nature of the problem made it difficult to apply local search to further improve the results. In this paper we hybridise NSGA-II with MOEA/D, which allows the problem to be decomposed into multiple single-objective subproblems where a simple form of local search can be applied. Experiment results show that the use of local search improves the quality of the fronts produced by the hybrid approach for a number of composition tasks.</p>

        <p>Designing effective dispatching rules for production systems is a difficult and time-consuming task if it is done manually. In the last decade, the growth of computing power, advanced machine learning, and optimisation techniques has made the automated design of dispatching rules possible and automatically discovered rules are competitive or outperform existing rules developed by researchers. Genetic programming is one of the most popular approaches to discovering dispatching rules in the literature, especially for complex production systems. However, the large heuristic search space may restrict genetic programming from finding near optimal dispatching rules. This article develops a new hybrid genetic programming algorithm for dynamic job shop scheduling based on a new representation, a new local search heuristic, and efficient fitness evaluators. Experiments show that the new method is effective regarding the quality of evolved rules. Moreover, evolved rules are also significantly smaller and contain more relevant attributes.</p>

        <p>Genetic Programming (GP) is gaining increased attention as an effective method for inducing classifiers for data classification. However, the manual design of a genetic programming classification algorithm is a non-trivial time consuming process. This research investigates the hypothesis that automating the design of a GP classification algorithm for data classification can still lead to the induction of effective classifiers and also reduce the design time. Two evolutionary algorithms, namely, a genetic algorithm (GA) and grammatical evolution (GE) are used to automate the design of GP classification algorithms. The classification performance of the automated designed GP classifiers i.e. GA designed GP classifiers and GE designed GP classifiers are compared to each other and to manually designed GP classifiers on real-world problems. Furthermore, a comparison of the design times of automated design and manual design is also carried out for the same set of problems. The automated designed classifiers were found to outperform manually designed classifiers across problem domains. Automated design time is also found to be less than manual design time. This study revealed that for the considered datasets GE performs better for binary classification while the GA does better for multiclass classification. Overall the results of the study are in support of the hypothesis.</p>

        <p>Evolutionary programming can solve black-box function optimisation problems by evolving a population of numerical vectors. The variation component in the evolutionary process is supplied by a mutation operator, which is typically a Gaussian, Cauchy, or Lévy probability distribution. In this paper, we use genetic programming to automatically generate mutation operators for an evolutionary programming system, testing the proposed approach over a set of function classes, which represent a source of functions. The empirical results over a set of benchmark function classes illustrate that genetic programming can evolve mutation operators which generalise well from the training set to the test set on each function class. The proposed method is able to outperform existing human designed mutation operators with statistical significance in most cases, with competitive results observed for the rest.</p>

        <p>The three articles in this special section focus on the development of automated design of machine learning and search algorithms. There is a demand, especially from industry and business, to automate the design of machine learning and search algorithms, thereby removing the heavy reliance on human experts. Machine learning and search techniques play an important role in solving real-world complex optimization problems in areas such as transportation, data mining, computer vision, computer security and software development, amongst others. Given the growing complexity of optimization problems, the design of effective algorithms to solve these problems has become more challenging and time consuming. The design process is itself an optimization problem.

        <p>Web services have become increasingly popular in recent years, given their modular nature and reusability potential. A particularly promising application is in Web service composition, where multiple individual services with specific functionalities are composed to accomplish a more complex task. Researchers have proposed evolutionary computing techniques for creating compositions that are not only feasible, but also have the best possible Quality of Service (QoS). Some of these works employed multi-objective techniques to tackle the optimisation of compositions with conflicting QoS attributes, but they are not fully automated, i.e. they assume the composition workflow structure is already known. This assumption is often not satisfied, as the workflow is often unknown. This paper proposes a genetic programming-based method to automatically generate service compositions in a multi-objective context, based on a novel fragmented tree representation. An evaluation using benchmark datasets is carried out, comparing existing methods adapted to the multi-objective composition problem. Results show that the fragmented method has the lowest execution time overall. In terms of quality, its Pareto fronts are equivalent to those of one of the approaches but inferior to those of the other. More importantly, this work provides a foundation for future investigation of multi-objective fully automated service composition.</p>

        <p>Actor-Critic (AC) algorithms are important approaches to solving sophisticated reinforcement learning problems. However, the learning performance of these algorithms rely heavily on good state features that are often designed manually. To address this issue, we propose to adopt an evolutionary approach based on NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topology (NEAT) to automatically evolve neural networks that directly transform the raw environmental inputs into state features. Following this idea, we have successfully developed a new algorithm called NEAT+AC which combines Regular-gradient Actor-Critic (RAC) with NEAT. It can simultaneously learn suitable state features as well as good policies that are expected to significantly improve the reinforcement learning performance. Preliminary experiments on two benchmark problems confirm that our new algorithm can clearly outperform the baseline algorithm, i.e., NEAT.</p>

        <p>Uncertain Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (UCARP) is a variant of the well-known CARP. It considers a variety of stochastic factors to reflect the reality where the exact information such as the actual task demand and accessibilities of edges are unknown in advance. Existing works focus on obtaining a robust solution beforehand. However, it is also important to design effective heuristics to adjust the solution in real time. In this paper, we develop a new Genetic Programming-based Hyper-Heuristic (GPHH) for automated heuristic design for UCARP. A novel effective meta-algorithm is designed carefully to address the failures caused by the environment change. In addition, it employs domain knowledge to filter some infeasible candidate tasks for the heuristic function. The experimental results show that the proposed GPHH significantly outperforms the existing GPHH methods and manually designed heuristics. Moreover, we find that eliminating the infeasible and distant tasks in advance can reduce much noise and improve the efficacy of the evolved heuristics. In addition, it is found that simply adding a slack factor to the expected task demand may not improve the performance of the GPHH.</p>

        <p>Recently there has been increased research interest in developing adaptive control systems for autonomous vehicles. This study presents a comparative evaluation of two distinct approaches to automated intersection management for a multiagent system of autonomous vehicles. The first is a centralized heuristic control approach using an extension of the Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) system. The second is a decentralized neuro-evolution approach that adapts vehicle controllers so as they collectively navigate intersections. This study tests both approaches for controlling groups of autonomous vehicles on a network of interconnected intersections, without the constraints of traffic lights or stop signals. These task environments thus simulate potential future scenarios where vehicles must drive autonomously without specific road infrastructure constraints. The capability of each approach to appropriately handle various types of interconnected intersections, while maintaining an efficient throughput of vehicles and minimizing delay is tested. Results indicate that neuro-evolution is an effective method for automating collective driving behaviors that are robust across a broad range of road networks, where evolved controllers yield comparable task performance or out-perform an AIM controller.</p>

        <p>Construction heuristics play an important role in solving combinatorial optimization problems. These heuristics are usually used to create an initial solution to the problem which is improved using optimization techniques such as metaheuristics. For examination timetabling and university course timetabling problems essentially graph colouring heuristics have been used for this purpose. The process of deriving heuristics manually for educational timetabling is a time consuming task. Furthermore, according to the no free lunch theorem different heuristics will perform well for different problems and problem instances. Hence, automating the induction of construction heuristics will reduce the man hours involved in creating such heuristics, allow for the derivation of problem specific heuristics and possibly result in the derivation of heuristics that humans have not thought of. This paper presents generation construction hyper-heuristics for educational timetabling. The study investigates the automatic induction of two types of construction heuristics, namely, arithmetic heuristics and hierarchical heuristics. Genetic programming is used to evolve arithmetic heuristics. Genetic programming, genetic algorithms and the generation of random heuristic combinations is examined for the generation of hierarchical heuristics. The hyper-heuristics generating both types of heuristics are applied to the examination timetabling and the curriculum based university course timetabling problems. The evolved heuristics were found to perform much better than the existing graph colouring heuristics used for this domain. Furthermore, it was found that the while the arithmetic heuristics were more effective for the examination timetabling problem, the hierarchical heuristics produced better results than the arithmetic heuristics for the curriculum based course timetabling problem. Genetic algorithms proved to be the most effective at inducing hierarchical heuristics.</p>

        <p>Automated examination timetabling has been addressed by a wide variety of methodologies and techniques over the last ten years or so. Many of the methods in this broad range of approaches have been evaluated on a collection of benchmark instances provided at the University of Toronto in 1996. Whilst the existence of these datasets has provided an invaluable resource for research into examination timetabling, the instances have significant limitations in terms of their relevance to real-world examination timetabling in modern universities. This paper presents a detailed model which draws upon experiences of implementing examination timetabling systems in universities in Europe, Australasia and America. This model represents the problem that was presented in the 2nd International Timetabling Competition (ITC2007). In presenting this detailed new model, this paper describes the examination timetabling track introduced as part of the competition. In addition to the model, the datasets used in the competition are also based on current real-world instances introduced by EventMAP Limited. It is hoped that the interest generated as part of the competition will lead to the development, investigation and application of a host of novel and exciting techniques to address this important real-world search domain. Moreover, the motivating goal of this paper is to close the currently existing gap between theory and practice in examination timetabling by presenting the research community with a rigorous model which represents the complexity of the real-world situation. In this paper we describe the model and its motivations, followed by a full formal definition.</p>

        <p>The performance of large groups of robots is often limited by a commonly shared resource. This effect, termed interference, can have a large impact on robotic swarms. This article studies the issue of interference in a swarm of robots working on a harvesting task. The environment of the robots is spatially constrained, i.e., there is a commonly shared resource, the nest, which limits the group’s performance when used without any arbitration mechanism. The article studies the use of task partitioning for reducing concurrent accesses to the resource, and therefore limiting the impact of interference on the group’s performance. In our study, we spatially partition the environment into two subparts, thereby partitioning the corresponding harvesting task as well. We employ a simple method to allocate individuals to the partitions. The approach is empirically studied both in an environment with a narrow nest area and an environment without this constraint. The results of the task partitioning strategy are analyzed and compared to the case in which task partitioning is not employed.</p>

        <p>The Second International Timetabling Competition (TTC2007) opened in August 2007. Building on the success of the first competition in 2002, this sequel aimed to further develop research activity in the area of educational timetabling. The broad aim of the competition was to create better understanding between researchers and practitioners by allowing emerging techniques to be developed and tested on real-world models of timetabling problems. To support this, a primary goal was to provide researchers with models of problems faced by practitioners through incorporating a significant number of real-world constraints. Another objective of the competition was to stimulate debate within the widening timetabling research community. The competition was divided into three tracks to reflect the important variations that exist in educational timetabling within higher education. Because these formulations incorporate an increased number of “real-world” issues, it is anticipated that the competition will now set the research agenda within the field. After finishing in January 2008, final results were made available in May 2008. Along with background to the competition, the competition tracks are described here along with a brief overview of the techniques used by the competition winners.</p>

        <p>Chapter 4 (entitled “Genetic Programming for Classification and Algorithm Design”), consists of two broad parts. The first part is about the classification task of data mining. In this first part, the chapter first explains important differences between classification models and classification algorithms - a crucial point to understand the contribution of this book, since the proposed genetic programming system produces a classification algorithm, rather than a classification model as usual in the literature. Then this chapter reviews genetic programming algorithms for evolving classification models, for evolving components of rule induction algorithms and for evolving classification systems as a whole (as a combination of datasets plus a classification algorithm). The second part of the chapter is about genetic programming for evolving the design of combinatorial optimization algorithms, rather than classification algorithms. Although combinatorial optimization is not the focus of this book, this topic was included in this chapter because the research on automatically evolving combinatorial optimization algorithms seems to be in a more advanced stage than the research on automatically evolving data mining algorithms, so that lessons from the former can be useful to the latter.</p>

        <p>Chapter 1 (entitled “Introduction”) consists of three parts. First, it briefly introduces the areas of data mining and evolutionary computation. Concerning data mining, the focus is on rule induction algorithms, which have the advantage of discovering knowledge expressed in the form of if-then classification rules that can be easily interpreted by the user, such as: if (Salary=high) and (Mortgage=no) then (Credit=good). Concerning evolutionary computation, the focus is on genetic programming, a type of method that uses inspiration from natural selection and genetics to automatically evolve computer programs. Secondly, this chapter explains the motivation for automating the design of data mining algorithms. It should be noted this is a new idea involving a whole new level of automation in data mining, since rule induction algorithms are normally manually designed by human experts. Thirdly, this chapter presents an overview of the proposed genetic programming system for automating the design of rule induction algorithms.</p>

        <p>Chapter 5 (entitled “Automating the Design of Rule Induction Algorithms”) describes in detail the main contribution of this book, which is a grammar-based genetic programming system for automatically evolving the design of rule induction algorithms. First, this chapter describes the grammar used by the system, which incorporates background knowledge about how human experts manually design a rule induction algorithm. Next, this chapter describes all other components of the system related to the genetic programming algorithm itself - i.e., individual representation, population initialization, individual evaluation (based on a single-objective or multiobjective fitness function) and finally crossover and mutation operations.</p>

        <p>Chapter 7 (entitled “Directions for Future Research on the Automatic Design of Data Mining Algorithms”) first summarizes the main contribution of the book, noting that the proposed genetic programming system automatically evolved rule induction algorithms competitive with well-known manually-designed algorithms, while also producing many automatically-designed algorithms that showed some aspects of innovation by comparison with manually-designed algorithms. Then the chapter proposes a number of directions for future research in the area, namely ideas for improving the grammar and the fitness function used by the genetic programming system, the idea of designing rule induction algorithms tailored to a type of datasets (involving a group of datasets with similar properties), investigating other types of search methods for automated algorithm design, automatically designing other types of classification algorithms (different from rule induction ones) or even other types of data mining algorithms, like clustering algorithms.</p>

        <p>Chapter 6 (entitled “Computational Results on the Automatic Design of Full Rule Induction Algorithms”), reports the results of extensive experiments performed to evaluate the proposed genetic programming system. This chapter is divided into two parts. In the first part the experiments evaluate the system’s effectiveness in producing rule induction algorithms robust across different application domains. In this part of the chapter we report results involving a number of issues, namely: (a) we investigate the system’s sensitivity to values of some parameters (like crossover and mutation rates, and the number of datasets used to “train” the system); (b) we compare the predictive accuracies obtained by the automatically evolved rule induction algorithms with the accuracies obtained by baseline well-known human-designed rule induction algorithms; (c) we discuss to what extent the automatically evolved algorithms differ from the manually-designed ones; (d) we investigate the system’s sensitivity to variations in the grammar; (e) we compare the effectiveness of genetic programming and hill-climbing search as different methods for searching in the space of candidate rule induction algorithms; and (f) we evaluate a multiobjective version of the proposed genetic programming system, based on the Pareto optimality concept. In the second part of this chapter the experiments evaluate the system’s effectiveness in producing rule induction algorithms tailored to a particular application domain. We first report the results of experiments evolving rule induction algorithms tailored to individual datasets of the well-known UCI (University of California at Irvine) dataset repository, and then report the results of experiments in more challenging datasets in the area of bioinformatics, involving protein function prediction. A brief overview of the problem of protein function prediction is included in this part of the chapter, to make it more self-contained.</p>

        <p>Chapter 2 (entitled “Data Mining") provides a review of the data mining concepts and methods relevant for an understanding of the genetic programming system proposed in this book. The focus is on the classification task of data mining – where, in essence, the goal is to predict the class of an example (record, data instance) based on values of its predictor attributes. This chapter discusses issues related to the predictive accuracy of a classification algorithm and discusses in more detail the motivation for focusing on rule induction algorithms, reviewing the importance of discovering predictive classification knowledge that can be interpreted by the user. It then discusses two types of algorithms often used to produce classification rules, namely decision tree induction and rule induction algorithms. The latter type of algorithms, in particular, is the most used method for inducing classification rules from data, and it is the type of algorithm whose design is automated by the genetic programming system proposed in this book. Rule induction algorithms and their components are therefore discussed in detail in this chapter. This chapter concludes with a discussion about meta-learning – whose basic idea is to “automatically learn about learning algorithms".</p>

        <p>Chapter 3 (entitled “Evolutionary Algorithms”) provides a review of the evolutionary computation concepts and methods relevant for an understanding of the genetic programming system proposed in this book. This chapter starts with a review of evolutionary algorithms in general, focusing on genetic algorithms-like methods, involving individuals represented by fixed-length linear strings. It then discusses concepts related to multiobjective optimization, in particular the Pareto optimality concept and the lexicographic approach for multiobjective optimization. Next, the chapter discusses important conceptual differences between genetic programming and genetic algorithms, from a critical perspective, and then it reviews genetic programming, focusing on a specific kind of genetic programming method called grammar-based genetic programming. As the name implies, this is a type of genetic programming method where the search for good programs is guided by a grammar, which incorporates background knowledge about the problem being solved.</p>

        <p>In this paper, we present a random iterative graph based hyper-heuristic to produce a collection of heuristic sequences to construct solutions of different quality. These heuristic sequences can be seen as dynamic hybridisations of different graph colouring heuristics that construct solutions step by step. Based on these sequences, we statistically analyse the way in which graph colouring heuristics are automatically hybridised. This, to our knowledge, represents a new direction in hyper-heuristic research. It is observed that spending the search effort on hybridising Largest Weighted Degree with Saturation Degree at the early stage of solution construction tends to generate high quality solutions. Based on these observations, an iterative hybrid approach is developed to adaptively hybridise these two graph colouring heuristics at different stages of solution construction. The overall aim here is to automate the heuristic design process, which draws upon an emerging research theme on developing computer methods to design and adapt heuristics automatically. Experimental results on benchmark exam timetabling and graph colouring problems demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of this adaptive hybrid approach compared with previous methods on automatically generating and adapting heuristics. Indeed, we also show that the approach is competitive with the state of the art human produced methods.</p>

        <p>This paper proposes a simple method to identify candidate tumors in a set of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images obtained from patients suffering from lymphoma, and then extract statistics from the image most active tumor. These statistics are used as input for three machine learning algorithms, which generate models for overall survival and event-free survival. The results obtained by these methods are better than the ones obtained by visual analysis, and competitive or better than the ones obtained by a quantitative measure of prognosis. Besides, the results indicate that there is a lot of redundant information coming from the images, and only 2 out of 10 attributes might be enough to predict prognosis.</p>

        <p>The main goal of this paper is to attempt an unbiased comparison of the performance of straightforward implementations of five different metaheuristics on a university course timetabling problem. In particular, the metaheuristics under consideration are Evolutionary Algorithms, Ant Colony Optimization, Iterated Local Search, Simulated Annealing, and Tabu Search. To attempt fairness, the implementations of all the algorithms use a common solution representation, and a common neighbourhood structure or local search. The results show that no metaheuristic is best on all the timetabling instances considered. Moreover, even when instances are very similar, from the point of view of the instance generator, it is not possible to predict the best metaheuristic, even if some trends appear when focusing on particular instance classes. These results underline the difficulty of finding the best metaheuristics even for very restricted classes of timetabling problem.</p>
